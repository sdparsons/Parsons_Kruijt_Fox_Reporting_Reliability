	abstract = {There have been several theoretical attempts to explain the effects of anxiety on cognitive performance. According to attentional control theory, anxiety impairs the efﬁciency of two executive functions (the inhibition and shifting functions). Another major theoretical assumption is that anxiety impairs performance effectiveness (the quality of performance) to a lesser extent than processing efﬁciency (the relationship between performance effectiveness and effort or use of processing resources). However, there may be conditions (e.g., prior presentation of threat-related stimuli) in which that assumption is not applicable. The extensive recent research (including several cognitive neuroscience studies) of direct relevance to the theory is discussed, and suggestions are made for maximizing the value of future cognitive neuroscience research. Finally, attentional control theory is developed to explicate the relationship between anxiety and motivation. Implications for theoretical predictions and alternative theoretical accounts are discussed.},

Assessment and modification of attentional biases for threat has been a major theme in this research program. The field has witnessed the development of progressively more sophisticated approaches for isolating attentional processes from other cognitive processes in the service of accurate assessment and treatment. Yet the field is now in crisis as foundational concerns about the reliability of basic measures of attentional bias for threat ({ABT}) have emerged. Moreover, recent research points to theoretical revisions deemphasizing {ABT} as a stable, near-universal feature of anxiety disorders, and stressing deficits in executive control as the primary attentional problem linked to anxiety.},

	abstract = {Background: In the current study, we investigated whether the internal reliability of the visual probe task measure of attentional bias for substance-related cues could be improved by incorporating eye-tracking methods and personalised stimuli.
Method: Sixty social drinkers completed two visual probe tasks: one with a broad range of different alcohol pictures, the other containing only images of the participants’ preferred drink. Attentional bias was inferred from manual reaction times to probes replacing the pictures, and from the duration of eye movement ﬁxations towards the pictures (gaze dwell time).
Results: Internal reliability was highest for personalised (versus general) alcohol stimuli, and for eyetracking (versus manual reaction time) measures of attentional bias. The internal reliability of both reaction time (˛ = .73) and gaze dwell time measures (˛ = .76) of attentional bias for personalised alcohol stimuli was acceptable. Internal reliability of indices of attentional bias for general alcohol stimuli was inferior, although better for the gaze dwell time (˛ = .51) compared to the reaction time measure (˛ = .19). Attentional bias towards personalised stimuli was larger than bias to general stimuli, but only for the reaction time measure. There were no statistically signiﬁcant associations between measures of attentional bias and alcohol consumption or craving.
Conclusions: Adopting personalised stimuli and eye movement monitoring signiﬁcantly improves the internal reliability of the alcohol-related visual probe task. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Results show that {ERPs} and R2(t) are highly reliable (cross-correlation {\textasciitilde} 0.9, lag {\textasciitilde} 4/6 ms, intra-class correlation {\textasciitilde} 0.9) but also idiosyncratic: {ERPs} and R2(t) are highly reproducible within subjects, who differ reliably from each other and the grand average across subjects. Consequently, grand averages, although highly reliable, can be misleading because they might not reﬂect the actual brain dynamic of any subjects.},

Recently, cognitive bias modiﬁcation ({CBM}) procedures have shown that such negative biases are causally related to emotional vulnerability. However, research using {CBM} has been notably lacking in depression. This is the ﬁrst double blind randomised controlled study investigating the effect of cognitive bias modiﬁcation-errors ({CBM}-errors), on depression and its inﬂuence on mood and resilience to stress. {CBM}-errors is a new form of cognitive bias modiﬁcation for interpretation, which targets the full range of cognitive errors, as well as interpretation biases. Forty clinically depressed participants were randomly allocated to a positive training group or neutral text reading control group. Participants trained to make positive interpretations subsequently interpreted novel ambiguous information in a positive manner compared to controls. The results suggest that a positive cognitive bias can be induced in clinically depressed individuals using a simple computerised intervention. There was little evidence of corresponding beneﬁts in terms of mood or response to stress, suggesting that multiple sessions are likely to be needed to confer symptom related change. A systematic investigation of the optimum number and timing of multiple sessions is now called for.},

The effects of the training on rumination and depression were examined. Participants were randomly assigned to four sessions of training to inhibit or to attend to negative stimuli or to a sham-training group, in a two-week span. At both pre and post training, participants completed measures of depressive symptoms, rumination and inhibition bias. Compared with individuals in the sham training condition, those who were trained to attend to negative stimuli exhibited a signiﬁcant decrease in inhibition of irrelevant negative content whereas those who were trained to inhibit negative stimuli, showed a trend toward improved inhibition of irrelevant negative content and a reduction in brooding, but not in depressive symptoms.

	abstract = {The dominant paradigm for inference in psychology is a null-hypothesis significance testing one. Recently, the foundations of this paradigm have been shaken by several notable replication failures. One recommendation to remedy the replication crisis is to collect larger samples of participants. We argue that this recommendation misses a critical point, which is that increasing sample size will not remedy psychology’s lack of strong measurement, lack of strong theories and models, and lack of effective experimental control over error variance. In contrast, there is a long history of research in psychology employing small-N designs that treats the individual participant as the replication unit, which addresses each of these failings, and which produces results that are robust and readily replicated. We illustrate the properties of small-N and {largeN} designs using a simulated paradigm investigating the stage structure of response times. Our simulations highlight the high power and inferential validity of the small-N design, in contrast to the lower power and inferential indeterminacy of the large-N design. We argue that, if psychology is to be a mature quantitative science, then its primary theoretical aim should be to investigate systematic, functional relationships as they are manifested at the individual participant level and that, wherever possible, it should use methods that are optimized to identify relationships of this kind.},

Although modiﬁcation of attention and interpretation biases has frequently been studied, it is not clear whether memory bias can be manipulated through direct training of emotional recall. In two studies (in undergraduate students and in a community sample), memory bias for emotional verbal stimuli was trained with cued recall of either positive or negative words. We did not ﬁnd evidence for malleability of memory bias for trained stimuli or induction of emotional reactivity to stress in either study. The training did, however, stimulate training-congruent incorrect recall in the community sample. Although we found no evidence for the direct modiﬁcation of memory bias, the more global effect obtained with respect to retrieval of emotional information from memory holds promise for {CBM}-memory studies in clinical samples.},

In order to examine the efﬁcacy of approach–avoidance modiﬁcation for positive stimuli associated with social anxiety, we recruited 43 individuals with social anxiety disorder and randomly assigned them to a training (implicit training to approach smiling faces) or a control (equal approach and avoidance of smiling faces) condition in three sessions over the course of a 1-week period. Dependent measures included clinician ratings, self-report measures of social anxiety, and overt behavior during behavioral approach tasks. No group differences in any of the outcome measures were observed after training. In addition, while individuals in the training group showed increased approach tendency in one of the sessions, this effect was inconsistent across the three sessions and did not result in long-term changes in implicit approach tendencies between the groups over the course of the entire study. These results suggest that approach–avoidance modiﬁcation might result in short-lasting effects on implicit approach tendencies towards feared positive stimuli, but this modiﬁcation may not result in meaningful behavioral change or symptom reduction in individuals with social anxiety disorder.},

An elaboration of this model is proposed to account for overgeneral memory, focusing on how memory search can be affected by (a) capture and rumination processes, when mnemonic information used in retrieval activates ruminative thinking; (b) functional avoidance, when episodic material threatens to cause affective disturbance; and (c) impairment in executive capacity and control that limits an individual’s ability to remain focused on retrieval in the face of distraction.},

If people process multiple streams of information concurrently, then preparatory processing requires a form of supervisory attention– central regulation to maintain unity of action. This concept is consistent with existing psychophysiological results and links them to current views of information processing. Conversely, psychophysiological measures may provide indices to test concepts within theories of the central regulation of action.},

For example, if test administration costs are 7 \% of the total experimental costs, the efficient value of the reliability is .93. If the actual reliability of a test is equal to this efficient reliability, the test size maximizes the statistical power of the experiment, given the costs.

Investigating the development of these factors in adolescence will help to improve understanding of emotional vulnerability and resilience. The {CogBIAS} longitudinal study ({CogBIAS}-L-S) aims to combine cognitive and genetic approaches to investigate risk and protective factors associated with the development of mood and impulsivity-related outcomes in an adolescent sample. Methods: {CogBIAS}-L-S is a three-wave longitudinal study of typically developing adolescents conducted over 4 years, with data collection at age 12, 14 and 16. At each wave participants will undergo multiple assessments including a range of selective cognitive processing tasks (e.g. attention bias, interpretation bias, memory bias) and psychological self-report measures (e.g. anxiety, depression, resilience). Saliva samples will also be collected at the baseline assessment for genetic analyses. Multilevel statistical analyses will be performed to investigate the developmental trajectory of cognitive biases on psychological functioning, as well as the influence of genetic moderation on these relationships. Discussion: {CogBIAS}-L-S represents the first longitudinal study to assess multiple cognitive biases across adolescent development and the largest study of its kind to collect genetic data. It therefore provides a unique opportunity to understand how genes and the environment influence the development and maintenance of cognitive biases and provide insight into risk and protective factors that may be key targets for intervention.},

In addition, those who switched more efficiently from an emotional set to a neutral set persisted longer on the stressful task.

	abstract = {Recent efforts have been made to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying psychological resilience. Cognitive flexibility in the context of affective information has been related to individual differences in resilience. However, it is unclear whether flexible affective processing is sensitive to mood fluctuations. Furthermore, it remains to be investigated how effects on flexible affective processing interact with the affective valence of information that is presented. To fill this gap, we tested the effects of positive mood and individual differences in self-reported resilience on affective flexibility, using a task switching paradigm (N ϭ 80). The main findings showed that positive mood was related to lower task switching costs, reflecting increased flexibility, in line with previous findings. In line with this effect of positive mood, we showed that greater resilience levels, specifically levels of acceptance of self and life, also facilitated task set switching in the context of affective information. However, the effects of resilience on affective flexibility seem more complex. Resilience tended to relate to more efficient task switching when negative information was preceded by positive information, possibly because the presentation of positive information, as well as positive mood, can facilitate task set switching. Positive mood also influenced costs associated with switching affective valence of the presented information. This latter effect was indicative of a reduced impact of no longer relevant negative information and more impact of no longer relevant positive information. Future research should confirm these effects of individual differences in resilience on affective flexibility, considering the affective valence of the presented information.},

	abstract = {Access to data is a critical feature of an efficient, progressive, and ultimately self-correcting scientific ecosystem. But the extent to which in-principle benefits of data sharing are realized in practice is unclear. Crucially, it is largely unknown whether published findings can be reproduced by repeating reported analyses upon shared data (“analytic reproducibility”). To investigate, we conducted an observational evaluation of a mandatory open data policy introduced at the journal Cognition. Interrupted time-series analyses indicated a substantial post-policy increase in data available statements (104/417, 25\% pre-policy to 136/174, 78\% post-policy), although not all data appeared reusable (23/104, 22\% pre-policy to 85/136, 62\%, post-policy). For 35 of the articles determined to have reusable data, we attempted to reproduce 1324 target values. Ultimately, 64 values could not be reproduced within a 10\% margin of error. For 22 articles all target values were reproduced, but 11 of these required author assistance. For 13 articles at least one value could not be reproduced despite author assistance. Importantly there were no clear indications that original conclusions were seriously impacted. Mandatory open data policies can increase the frequency and quality of data sharing. However, suboptimal data curation, unclear analysis specification, and reporting errors can impede analytic reproducibility, undermining the utility of data sharing and the credibility of scientific findings.},

	abstract = {To cast valid predictions of future behavior or diagnose disorders, the reliable measurement of a “biomarker” such as the brain activation to prospective reward is a prerequisite. Surprisingly, only a small fraction of functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) studies report or cite the reliability of brain activation maps involved in group analyses. Here, using simulations and exemplary longitudinal data of 126 healthy adolescents performing an intertemporal choice task, we demonstrate that reproducing a group activation map over time is not a sufficient indication of reliable measurements at the individual level. Instead, selecting regions based on significant main effects at the group level may yield estimates that fail to reliably capture individual variance in the subjective evaluation of an offer. Collectively, our results call for more attention on the reliability of supposed biomarkers at the level of the individual. Thus, caution is warranted in employing brain activation patterns prematurely for clinical applications such as diagnosis or tailored interventions before their reliability has been conclusively established by large-scale studies. To facilitate assessing and reporting of the reliability of {fMRI} contrasts in future studies, we provide a toolbox that incorporates common measures of global and local reliability.},

The purpose of this investigation was to (a) determine the frequency with which published articles appearing in health education and behavior journals report the psychometric properties of the scales/subscales employed and (b) outline the methods used to determine the reliability and validity of the scores produced. The results reported herein are based on a final sample of 967 published articles, spanning seven prominent health education and behavior journals between 2007 and 2010. Of the 967 articles examined, an exceedingly high percentage failed to report any validity (ranging from 40\% to 93\%) or reliability (ranging from 35\% to 80\%) statistics in their articles. For health education/behavior practitioners and researchers to maximize the utility and applicability of their findings, they must evaluate the psychometric properties of the instrument employed, a practice that is currently underrepresented in the literature. By not ensuring the instruments employed in a given study were able to produce accurate and consistent scores, researchers cannot be certain they actually measured the behaviors and/or constructs reported.},

	title = {Power, Dominance, and Constraint: A Note on the Appeal of Different Design Traditions},
	abstract = {The recent field-wide emphasis on power has brought the number of participants used in psychological experiments into focus. Social psychology typically follows a tradition in which many participants perform a small number of trials each; in psychophysics, the tradition is to include only a few participants, who perform many trials each; and the tradition in cognitive psychology falls in between, balancing the number of participants and trials. We ask whether it is better to add trials or to add participants if one wishes to increase power. The answer is straightforward—greatest power is achieved by using more people, and the gain from adding people is greater than the gain from adding trials. In light of these results, the design parameters in the social psychology tradition seem ideal. Yet there are conditions in which one may trade people for trials with only a minor decrement in power. Under these conditions, the limiting factor is the trial-to-trial variability rather than the variability across people in the population. These conditions are highly plausible, and we present a theoretical argument as to why. We think that most cognitive effects are characterized by stochastic dominance; that is, everyone’s true effect is in the same direction. For example, it is plausible that when performing the Stroop task, all people truly identify congruent colors faster than incongruent ones. When dominance holds, small mean effects imply a small degree of variability across the population. It is this degree of homogeneity, the consequence of dominance, that licenses the design parameters of the cognitive psychology and psychophysics traditions.},

Objective: In this study, we extended this work by estimating the structure of relations among {PTSD} symptoms in adults reporting personal histories of childhood sexual abuse ({CSA}; N = 179).
Method: We employed two complementary methods. First, using the graphical {LASSO}, we computed a sparse, regularized partial correlation network revealing associations (edges) between pairs of {PTSD} symptoms (nodes). Next, using a Bayesian approach, we computed a directed acyclic graph ({DAG}) to estimate a directed, potentially causal model of the relations among symptoms.
Results: For the first network, we found that physiological reactivity to reminders of trauma, dreams about the trauma, and lost of interest in previously enjoyed activities were highly central nodes. However, stability analyses suggest that these findings were unstable across subsets of our sample. The {DAG} suggests that becoming physiologically reactive and upset in response to reminders of the trauma may be key drivers of other symptoms in adult survivors of {CSA}.
Conclusions: Our study illustrates the strengths and limitations of these network analytic approaches to {PTSD}.},

A three-step procedure is proposed for its estimation, including descriptive data analysis, test of relevant measurement models, and computation of internal consistency coefficient and its confidence interval. Provided formulas include: (a) Cronbach’s alpha and omega coefficients for unidimensional measures with quantitative item response scales, (b) coefficients ordinal omega, ordinal alpha and nonlinear reliability for unidimensional measures with dichotomic and ordinal items, (c) coefficients omega and omega hierarchical for essentially unidimensional scales presenting method effects. The procedure is generalized to weighted sum measures, multidimensional scales, complex designs with multilevel and/or missing data and to scale development.

	abstract = {Background: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and, although efficacious treatments are available, their efficacy is suboptimal and recurrence of symptoms is common. Effective preventive strategies could reduce disability and the long term social and health complications associated with the disorder, but current options are limited. Cognitive bias modification ({CBM}) is a novel, simple, and safe intervention that addresses attentional and interpretive biases associated with anxiety, dysphoria, and depression. The primary aim of this trial is to determine if {CBM} decreases the one-year onset of a major depressive episode among adults with subsyndromal depression. Design and methods: This randomised controlled trial will recruit 532 adults with subsyndromal symptoms of depression living in the Australian community (parallel design, 1:1 allocation ratio). Participants will be free of clinically significant symptoms of depression and of psychotic disorders, sensory and cognitive impairment, and risky alcohol use. The {CBM} intervention will target attentional and interpretive biases associated with depressive symptoms. The sessions will be delivered via the internet over a period of 52 weeks. The primary outcome of interest is the onset of a major depressive episode according the {DSM}-{IV}-{TR} criteria over a 12-month period. Secondary outcomes of interest include change in the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire ({PHQ}-9), use of antidepressants or benzodiazepines, and changes in attention and interpretive biases. The assessment of outcomes will take place 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after randomisation and will occur via the internet. Discussion: We propose to test the efficacy of an innovative intervention that is well grounded in theory and for which increasing empirical evidence for an effect on mood is available. The intervention is simple, inexpensive, easy to access, and could be easily rolled out into practice if our findings confirm a role for {CBM} in the prevention of depression.

In the current paper, we report a direct test of this hypothesis in individuals with social phobia. Participants performed a variation of the Posner paradigm (Quart. J. Exp. Psycho. 32 (1980) 3). Social threat, neutral, or positive words cued one of two locations on the computer screen. After the cue disappeared, participants had to detect a probe (“∗”) that appeared in one of the two locations. On some trials the cue was valid (i.e., the probe appeared in the same location as the cue). On other trials the cue was invalid (the probe appeared in a different location than the cue). Yet, on other trials, no cue was presented. All participants were slower in detecting probes following invalid cues than probes following valid cues. Furthermore, individuals with social phobia showed signiﬁcantly longer response latencies when detecting invalidly cued targets than did controls, but only when the probe followed a social threat word. These results suggest that individuals with social phobia may have difﬁculty disengaging their attention from socially threatening material.},

The present review examines methodologies suited to identify such symptom networks and discusses network analysis techniques that may be used to extract clinically and scientiﬁcally useful information from such networks (e.g., which symptom is most central in a person’s network). The authors also show how network analysis techniques may be used to construct simulation models that mimic symptom dynamics. Network approaches naturally explain the limited success of traditional research strategies, which are typically based on the idea that symptoms are manifestations of some common underlying factor, while offering promising methodological alternatives. In addition, these techniques may offer possibilities to guide and evaluate therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Objective: The Attention Network Test ({ANT}) is a tool used to assess the efﬁciency of the 3 attention networks—alerting, orienting, and executive control. The {ANT} has become popular in the neuropsychological literature since its ﬁrst description in 2002, with some form of the task currently appearing in no less than 65 original research papers. Although several general reviews of the {ANT} exist, none provide an analysis of its psychometric properties. Method: Data from 15 unique studies were collected, resulting in a large sample (N ϭ 1,129) of healthy individuals. Split-half reliability, variance structure, distribution shape, and independence of measurement of the 3 attention network scores were analyzed, considering both reaction time and accuracy as dependent variables. Results: Split-half reliabilities of reaction time based attention network scores were low for alerting (rweighted ϭ .20, {CI} 95\%weighted [.14, .27], Spearman–Brown r ϭ .38) and orienting (rweighted ϭ .32, {CI} 95\%weighted [.26, .38], Spearman–Brown r ϭ .55), and moderate high for executive control (rweighted ϭ .65, {CI} 95\%weighted [.61, .71], Spearman–Brown r ϭ .81). Analysis of the variance structure of the {ANT} indicated that power to ﬁnd signiﬁcant effects was variable across networks and dependent on the statistical analysis being used. Both analysis of variance (signiﬁcant interaction observed in 100\% of 15 studies) and correlational analyses (multiplesigniﬁcant inter-network correlations observed) suggest that the networks measured by the {ANT} are not independent. Conclusions: In the collection, analysis and interpretation of any test data, psychometric properties, such as those reported here for the {ANT}, must be carefully considered.},

Imposing a working memory ({WM}) load during training should therefore limit its efﬁcacy, since {WM} resources are required for goal-driven control of attention. Twenty-eight subclinical high-anxious participants completed two sessions of {CBM}-A or placebo training: one under a high {WM} load, and one under a low {WM} load. Attentional bias was assessed after each training. {CBM}-A produced an attentional bias away from threat under low load, but not under high load.

The current study assessed the reliability and convergent validity of dot probe and emotional cueing bias scores in high-anxious and low-anxious participants in the context of a state anxiety manipulation to increase the likelihood of producing large, potentially reliable attentional biases. One hundred sixty participants completed an anxious or calm mood induction followed by dot probe and emotional cueing tasks. Reliability estimates for bias scores in the full sample were low, ranging from 0 to .44; convergent validity estimates were also poor. The anxiety induction did not substantially improve the reliability or validity of the measures.

We know relatively little, however, about the speciﬁc factors that contribute to this elevated risk. The present study investigated the effects of familial risk for depression and the 5-{HTTLPR} and {COMT} Val158Met polymorphisms, which have been associated with risk for depression, on biases in endorsement of and memory for positive and negative adjectives.
Methods: Following a negative mood induction, 60 girls between the ages of 10 and 14 who had recurrent depressed mothers (high risk for depression) and 91 age-matched daughters of neverdisordered mothers (low risk for depression) completed a Self-Referent Encoding Task in which they decided whether negative and positive adjectives described them. Following the task they were asked to recall as many of the adjectives as they could.
Results: Despite the absence of signiﬁcant group differences in endorsement of positive or negative adjectives, high-risk girls with the {COMT} Val158Met Val/Val polymorphism recalled more positive (but not negative) words that they had endorsed than did high-risk girls who were homozygous for the Met allele. {COMT} was not associated with recall of valenced adjectives in low-risk girls. Across risk groups, 5-{HTTLPR} polymorphism was not associated with recall of valenced adjectives. Limitations: Even with over 150 participants, there were relatively small numbers in some of the cells of this study, limiting its statistical power.
Conclusions: These results suggest that assessing the interaction of familial risk status and {COMT} polymorphism is important in understanding the development of depressive disorders. \& 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Results indicate a general absence of emotional validity effects as well as a lack of significant interactions with either of the manipulated factors, indicating that facial expressions of emotions do not capture attention in a fully automatic fashion.

Recent interventions targeting {WM} have suggested plasticity of the {WM} system by demonstrating improvements in both trained and untrained {WM} tasks. However, evidence on transfer of improved {WM} into more general cognitive domains such as fluid intelligence (Gf) has been more equivocal. Therefore, we conducted a metaanalysis focusing on one specific training program, n-back. We searched {PubMed} and Google Scholar for all n-back training studies with Gf outcome measures, a control group, and healthy participants between 18 and 50 years of age. In total, we included 20 studies in our analyses that met our criteria and found a small but significant positive effect of nback training on improving Gf. Several factors that moderate this transfer are identified and discussed. We conclude that short-term cognitive training on the order of weeks can result in beneficial effects in important cognitive functions as measured by laboratory tests.},

	abstract = {Efficient detection of threat provides obvious survival advantages and has resulted in a fast and accurate threatdetection system. Although beneficial under normal circumstances, this system may become hypersensitive and cause threat-processing abnormalities. Past research has shown that anxious individuals have difficulty disengaging attention from threatening faces, but it is unknown whether other forms of threatening social stimuli also influence attentional orienting. Much like faces, human body postures are salient social stimuli, because they are informative of one’s emotional state and next likely action. Additionally, postures can convey such information in situations in which another’s facial expression is not easily visible. Here we investigated whether there is a threat-specific effect for high-anxious individuals, by measuring the time that it takes the eyes to leave the attended stimulus, a task-irrelevant body posture. The results showed that relative to nonthreating postures, threat-related postures hold attention in anxious individuals, providing further evidence of an anxiety-related attentional bias for threatening information. This is the first study to demonstrate that attentional disengagement from threatening postures is affected by emotional valence in those reporting anxiety.},

	abstract = {The efﬁcacy of interventions might be underestimated or even go undetected as a main effect when it is hidden in gene-by-environment (G × E) interactions. This review moves beyond the problems thwarting correlational G × E research to propose genetic differential susceptibility experiments. G × E experiments can test the bright side as well as the dark side of the moderating role of genotypes traditionally considered to represent vulnerability to negative conditions. The differential susceptibility model predicts that carriers of these risk genotypes proﬁt most from interventions changing the environment for the better. The evolutionary background of G × E and differential susceptibility is discussed, and statistical methods for the analysis of differential susceptibility (versus diathesis stress) are reviewed. Then, based on results from 22 randomized G × E experiments, meta-analytic evidence for the differential susceptibility model is presented. Intervention effects are much stronger in the susceptible genotypes than in the nonsusceptible genotypes. The ﬁnal sections suggest possibilities to broaden the G component in the G × E equation by including genetic pathways, and to broaden the E component by including methylation level and gene expression as promising ways to probe the concept of the environment more deeply and address the perennial issue of what works for whom.},

This process was characterized both at the behavioral and electro-encephalographic levels. Thirty two participants were randomly allocated either to a positive or a neutral (control) mood condition. Behavioral results showed that while learning performance was balanced between the two groups, participants in the positive mood group had a higher learning rate than participants in the neutral mood group. At the electrophysiological level, we found that positive mood increased the error-related negativity when the stimulus–response associations were deterministic, selectively (as opposed to random or probabilistic). However, it did not inﬂuence the feedback-related negativity. These new ﬁndings are discussed in terms of an enhanced internal reward prediction error signal after the induction of positive mood when the probability of getting a reward is high.},

	abstract = {The serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor ({SNRI}) duloxetine is an effective treatment for major depression and generalised anxiety disorder. Neuropsychological models of antidepressant drug action suggest therapeutic effects might be mediated by the early correction of maladaptive biases in emotion processing, including the recognition of emotional expressions. Sub-chronic administration of duloxetine (for two weeks) produces adaptive changes in neural circuitry implicated in emotion processing; however, its effects on emotional expression recognition are unknown. Forty healthy participants were randomised to receive either 14 days of duloxetine (60 mg/day, titrated from 30 mg after three days) or matched placebo (with sham titration) in a double-blind, between-groups, repeated-measures design. On day 0 and day 14 participants completed a computerised emotional expression recognition task that measured sensitivity to the six primary emotions. Thirty-eight participants (19 per group) completed their course of tablets and were included in the analysis. Results provide evidence that duloxetine, compared to placebo, may reduce the accurate recognition of sadness. Drug effects were driven by changes in participants’ ability to correctly detect subtle expressions of sadness, with greater change observed in the placebo relative to the duloxetine group. These effects occurred in the absence of changes in mood. Our preliminary findings require replication, but complement recent evidence that sadness recognition is a therapeutic target in major depression, and a mechanism through which {SNRIs} could resolve negative biases in emotion processing to achieve therapeutic effects.},

Signiﬁcant differences between moderate and ﬂourishing groups consisted of behaviors that ‘prevented’ rather than ‘promoted’ ﬂourishing (e.g., behavioral and cognitive avoidance). These ﬁndings suggest that in order to achieve ﬂourishing, individuals may need to reduce avoidance strategies and increase engagement strategies.},

An associative mode involves quick, effortless processing that rests on well-learned associations. A reflective mode involves slow, effortful processing that rests on symbolic rule-based inferences. Whereas the associative mode occurs automatically, the reflective mode operates when expectancies are violated and sufficient cognitive resources are available to respond. A cognitive vulnerability to depression is observed when negatively biased associative processing is uncorrected by reflective processing. The circumstances when this is likely to occur are reviewed.

Here, we investigated this effect while varying the level of cognitive load in a modiﬁed antisaccade task that employed emotional facial expressions (neutral, happy, and angry) as targets. Load was manipulated using a secondary auditory task requiring recognition of tones (low load), or recognition of speciﬁc tone pitch (high load). Results showed that load increased antisaccade latencies on trials where gaze toward face stimuli should be inhibited. This effect was exacerbated for high anxious individuals. Emotional expression also modulated task performance on antisaccade trials for both high and low anxious participants under low cognitive load, but did not inﬂuence performance under high load. Collectively, results (1) suggest that individuals reporting high levels of anxiety are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cognitive load on inhibition, and (2) support recent evidence that loading cognitive processes can reduce emotional inﬂuences on attention and cognition.},

Anticipatory preparation for an upcoming task switch is a hallmark of top-down intentional control. Meanwhile, asymmetries in performance and voluntary choice when switching between tasks differing in relative strength reveal the effects of between-task competition, reﬂected in a surprising bias against switching to an easier task. Here, we assessed the impact of this bias on {EEG} markers of intentional control during preparation for an upcoming task switch. The results revealed strong and varied effects of between-task competition on {EEG} markers of global task preparation—a frontal contingent negative variation ({CNV}), a posterior slow positive wave, and oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8–12 Hz) over posterior scalp sites. In contrast, we observed no between-task differences in motor-speciﬁc task preparation, as indexed by the lateralized readiness potential and by motor-related amplitude asymmetries in the mu (9–13 Hz) and beta (18–26 Hz) frequency bands. Collectively, these ﬁndings demonstrate that between-task competition directly inﬂuences the formation of top-down intentions, not only their expression in overt behavior. Speciﬁcally, this inﬂuence occurs at the level of global task intention rather than the preparation of speciﬁc actions.},

	abstract = {The current cognitive bias modiﬁcation ({CBM}) paradigm targets interpretation bias ({CBM}-I) in depression via promoting positive imagery. We investigated the impact of repeated sessions of this {CBM}-I on interpretation bias, mood and mental health in participants currently experiencing a major depressive episode. Seven participants completed daily sessions of {CBM}-I at home for one week in a single case series. Outcome measures were completed pre and post a one-week baseline period, and after the week of daily {CBM}-I. Depressive symptoms were also assessed at a 2-week follow-up. Four of seven participants demonstrated improvements in mood, bias and/or mental health after one week of {CBM}-I, with improvements in depressive symptoms maintained at follow-up. Discussion of the remaining three highlights difﬁculties involved in translating {CBM}-I interventions from the laboratory to the clinic. To bridge this gap, we suggest that it is critical to examine the failures as well as the successes. Copyright \# 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The development of psychological interventions to boost optimism derived from cognitive science would have the potential to provide signiﬁcant public health beneﬁts, yet cognitive markers of optimism are little understood. The current study aimed to take a ﬁrst step in this direction by identifying a cognitive marker for optimism that could provide a modiﬁable target for innovative interventions. In particular we predicted that the ability to generate vivid positive mental imagery of the future would be associated with dispositional optimism. A community sample of 237 participants completed a survey comprising measures of mental imagery and optimism, and socio-demographic information. Vividness of positive future imagery was signiﬁcantly associated with optimism, even when adjusting for socio-demographic factors and everyday imagery use. The ability to generate vivid mental imagery of positive future events may provide a modiﬁable cognitive marker of optimism. Boosting positive future imagery could provide a cognitive target for treatment innovations to promote optimism, with implications for mental health and even physical wellbeing.},

	abstract = {Risk assessment is a pattern of activities involved in detection and analysis of threat stimuli and the situations in which the threat is encountered. It is a core process in the choice of speciﬁc defenses, such as ﬂight, freezing, defensive threat and defensive attack, that counter the threat and minimize the danger it poses. This highly adaptive process takes into account important characteristics, such as type and location (including distance from the subject) of the threat, as well as those (e.g. presence of an escape route or hiding place) of the situation, combining them to predict which speciﬁc defense is optimal with that particular combination of threat and situation. Risk assessment is particularly associated with ambiguity either of the threat stimulus or of the outcome of available defensive behaviors. It is also crucial in determining that threat is no longer present, permitting a return to normal, nondefensive behavior. Although risk assessment has been described in detail in rodents, it is also a feature of human defensive behavior, particularly in association with ambiguity. Rumination may be a speciﬁcally human form of risk assessment, more often expressed by women, and highly associated with anxiety.},

	shorttitle = {Testing for baseline differences in randomized controlled trials},
	abstract = {Background: According to the {CONSORT} statement, significance testing of baseline differences in randomized controlled trials should not be performed. In fact, this practice has been discouraged by numerous authors throughout the last forty years. During that time span, reporting of baseline differences has substantially decreased in the leading general medical journals. Our own experience in the field of nutrition behavior research however, is that co-authors, reviewers and even editors are still very persistent in their demand for these tests. The aim of this paper is therefore to negate this demand by providing clear evidence as to why testing for baseline differences between intervention groups statistically is superfluous and why such results should not be published. Discussion: Testing for baseline differences is often propagated because of the belief that it shows whether randomization was successful and it identifies real or important differences between treatment arms that should be accounted for in the statistical analyses. Especially the latter argument is flawed, because it ignores the fact that the prognostic strength of a variable is also important when the interest is in adjustment for confounding. In addition, including prognostic variables as covariates can increase the precision of the effect estimate. This means that choosing covariates based on significance tests for baseline differences might lead to omissions of important covariates and, less importantly, to inclusion of irrelevant covariates in the analysis. We used data from four supermarket trials on the effects of pricing strategies on fruit and vegetables purchases, to show that results from fully adjusted analyses sometimes do appreciably differ from results from analyses adjusted for significant baseline differences only. We propose to adjust for known or anticipated important prognostic variables. These could or should be pre-specified in trial protocols. Subsequently, authors should report results from the fully adjusted as well as crude analyses, especially for dichotomous and time to event data. Summary: Based on our arguments, which were illustrated by our findings, we propose that journals in and outside the field of nutrition behavior actively adopt the {CONSORT} 2010 statement on this topic by not publishing significance tests for baseline differences anymore.},

Rather, both well-being (positive mental health) and mental illness are actually two related continua, with higher levels of well-being deﬁned as “ﬂourishing.” This two-continua model and existing studies about the impact of ﬂourishing on psychopathology underscore the need for interventions that enhance ﬂourishing and well-being. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ({ACT}) is a model of cognitive behavioral therapy that aims not only to reduce psychopathology but also to promote ﬂourishing as well. This is the ﬁrst study to evaluate the impact of {ACT} on ﬂourishing. A post-analysis was conducted on an earlier randomized controlled trial of a sample of adults with depressive symptomatology who participated in a guided self-help {ACT} intervention. This post-analysis showed a 5\%e28\% increase of ﬂourishing by the participants. In addition, the effects on ﬂourishing were maintained at the three-month follow-up. When compared to participants in a control group, the ﬂourishing of the {ACT}-trained participants increased from 5\% to about 14\% after nine weeks. In addition to levels of positive mental health at baseline, an increase of psychological ﬂexibility during the intervention was a signiﬁcant predictor of ﬂourishing at the three-month follow-up.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientiﬁc theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufﬁciently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel deﬁnitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.},

Usually, models for emotion regulation assume mechanisms based on feedback loops that indicate how to change certain aspects of behavior or cognitive functioning in order to get a more satisfactory emotion response level. Adaptation of such feedback loops is usually left out of consideration. This paper introduces an adaptive computational model for emotion regulation by formalizing the model informally described by Gross (1998). The model has been constructed using a high-level modeling language, and integrates both quantitative aspects (such as levels of emotional response) and qualitative aspects (such as decisions to regulate one’s emotion). This model includes mechanisms for adaptivity of the degree of ﬂexibility of the emotion regulation process. Also, the eﬀects of events like traumas or therapies on emotion regulation can be simulated. Based on this computational model, a number of simulation experiments have been performed and evaluated.

A range of methods and paradigms have been used to investigate various aspects of abnormal processing of facial expressions in major depression, including emotion specific deficits in recognition accuracy, response biases and attentional biases. The aim of this review is to examine and interpret data from studies of facial emotion processing in major depression, in the context of current knowledge about the neural correlates of facial expression processing of primary emotions. The review also discusses the methodologies used to examine facial expression processing. Studies of facial emotion processing and facial emotion recognition were identified up to December 2009 utilizing {MEDLINE} and Web of Science. Although methodological variations complicate interpretation of findings, there is reasonably consistent evidence of a negative response bias towards sadness in individuals with major depression, so that positive (happy), neutral or ambiguous facial expressions tend to be evaluated as more sad or less happy compared with healthy control groups. There is also evidence of increased vigilance and selective attention towards sad expressions and away from happy expressions, but less evidence of reduced general or emotion-specific recognition accuracy. Data is complicated by the use of multiple paradigms and the heterogeneity of major depression. Future studies should address methodological problems, including variations in patient characteristics, testing paradigms and procedures, and statistical methods used to analyse findings.},

The implicit memory test was a primed lexica1 decision task, which included anxiety- and depression-relevant words, and supraliminal and subliminal priming conditions. The explicit memory test was incidental free recall following a self-referent encoding task. Subjects were divided into high and low negative affect groups, differing in trait and state anxiety, and depression scores. The high negative affect group showed greater subliminal priming of depression-relevant than neutral control words compared with the low negative affect group. This selective priming effect was more closely associated with depression than anxiety measures. There was little direct evidence of emotion-congruent biases on the supraliminally primed lexical decision and free recall tasks, although when the effects of anxiety were partialled out depression scores predicted relatively better recall of depression-relevant words. In conclusion, the main results suggest that non-clinical depression is associated with a mood-con{\textasciitilde}uent bias in automatic aspects of implicit memory.},

Considering the functional links between perception, attention, and action regulation, we posit that when people can avoid the aversive consequences, sensitivity of the perceptual system to danger signals should be enhanced, whereas it should be reduced when there is no such option. To test this prediction, we used a search task in which tachistoscopically presented conjunctions of features had to be detected. Parameters of sensitivity and response bias were analyzed drawing on procedures from signal detection theory. Although the experimental procedure rewarded correct responses, the predicted asymmetry emerged. For stimuli that were linked to a negative consequence (loss of points in the experimental game), perceptual sensitivity was enhanced when participants had the opportunity to neutralize the loss in a second task; an opposite pattern emerged when they had no such opportunity.},

	abstract = {Memory impairment is the most commonly reported cognitive symptom associated with major depressive disorder. Decreased hippocampal volume and neurogenesis in depression link hippocampal dysfunction with deﬁcits in memory. Stress decreases hippocampal dendritic spine density and long-term potentiation ({LTP}) at glutamate synapses, a cellular correlate of learning and memory. However, elevated plasma levels of 17b estradiol (E2) during proestrus increase hippocampal structure and function, directly opposing the negative consequences of stress. In women, signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in ovarian hormones likely increase vulnerability of hippocampal circuits to stress, potentially contributing to the greater incidence of depression compared to men. Using the learned helplessness model of depression and ovariectomized female rats, we investigated whether acquisition of helplessness and hippocampal synaptic dysfunction is differentially impacted by the presence or absence of plasma E2. We ﬁnd that inescapable shock induces a greater incidence of helplessness in vehicle- versus E2-treated {OVX} rats. In the vehicletreated group, {LTP} was absent at {CA}3-{CA}1 synapses in slices only from helpless rats, and {CA}1 spine density was decreased compared to resilient rats. In contrast, signiﬁcant {LTP} was observed in slices from E2-treated helpless rats; importantly, spine density was not different between E2treated helpless and resilient rats, dissociating spine density from the {LTP} magnitude. We also ﬁnd that E2 replacement can reverse previously established helpless behavior. Thus, our results show that E2 replacement in {OVX} rats increases resilience and improves hippocampal plasticity, suggesting that E2 therapy may increase resilience to stress and preserve hippocampal function in women experiencing large ﬂuctuations in plasma estrogen levels.},

In each task, threat bias was assessed using bias scores reﬂecting task performance on threat versus non-threat conditions. Reliability was assessed using split–half and test–retest correlations of mean reaction times ({RTs}), accuracy and bias indices. Convergence between measures was also examined. Mean {RTs} showed substantial split–half and test–retest correlations. Bias score reliability coefﬁcients were near zero and non-signiﬁcant, suggesting poor reliability in children of this age. Additionally, associations between bias scores and anxiety were weak and inconsistent and performance between tasks showed little convergence. Bias scores from {RT} based paradigms in the current study lacked adequate psychometric properties for measuring individual differences in anxiety-related information-processing in children.},

It remains unclear, however, whether socially anxious individuals are in fact more sensitive to disapproving emotions. We assessed decoding of, and cost attributions to, emotional expressions in high and low socially anxious females (n ¼102) using ﬁve emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness) expressed at 15 intensities (9–65\%), providing 75 stimuli (see Supplementary Material). The decoding task brieﬂy presented the stimuli and participants identiﬁed the emotion. The cost attribution task asked individuals to rate each stimulus for how costly it would be for them to interact with the person. Random effects regression indicated that social anxiety was not associated with overall decoding accuracy but was associated with a response bias. High socially anxious individuals had a lower threshold for decoding emotions but also more frequently classiﬁed low intensity emotions incorrectly. These effects were not emotion-speciﬁc. Socially anxious individuals also attributed excessive social cost to expressions of negative valence. Our results provide a novel conceptual framework for understanding emotion decoding in social anxiety, indicating the importance of considering both accuracy and response bias.},

	abstract = {Flourishing—a state of optimal mental health— has been linked to a host of benefits for the individual and society, including fewer workdays lost and the lowest incidence of chronic physical conditions. The aim of this paper was to investigate whether and how routine activities promote flourishing. The authors proposed that flourishers thrive because they capitalize on the processes featured in the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, specifically by experiencing greater positive emotional reactivity to pleasant events and building more resources over time. To test these hypotheses, the Day Reconstruction Method ({DRM}) was administered to a prescreened community sample of adults (n ϭ 208), and they were recontacted two to three months later. Results showed that relative to those who did not flourish or were depressed, people who flourish generally responded with bigger “boosts” in positive emotions in response to everyday, pleasant events (helping, interacting, playing, learning, spiritual activity), and this greater positive emotional reactivity, over time, predicted higher levels of two facets of the cognitive resource of mindfulness. In turn, these higher levels of mindfulness were positively associated with higher levels of flourishing at the end of study, controlling for initial levels of flourishing. These results suggest that the promotion of well-being may be fueled by small, yet consequential differences in individuals’ emotional experience of pleasant everyday events. Additionally, these results underscore the utility of the broadenand-build theory in understanding the processes by which flourishing is promoted and provide support for a positive potentiation perspective.},

The researchers assessed naturalistic shifts in attentional bias toward threatening and pleasant schematic face cues in response to five induced mood states in college students. They also assessed state anxiety and satisfaction with life concurrently and 3 weeks later. Controlling for concurrent anxiety, a fear-induced shift in attention to threatening cues was associated with increased levels of later anxiety. Controlling for concurrent life satisfaction, a happiness-induced shift in attention to emotional cues (both threatening and pleasant) was associated with increased levels of later life satisfaction. These results suggest that mood-induced changes in deployment of attention to emotional information may accumulate in ways that impact psychological functioning, yet these effects depend on mood state and the emotional cues afforded by the context.},

	abstract = {Animals that experience adverse events in early life often have life-long changes to their physiology and behavior. Long-term effects of stress during early life have been studied extensively, but less attention has been given to the consequences of negative experiences solely during the adolescent phase. Adolescence is a particularly sensitive period of life when regulation of the glucocorticoid “stress” hormone response matures and speciﬁc regions in the brain undergo considerable change. Aversive experiences during this time might, therefore, be expected to generate long-term consequences for the adult phenotype. Here we investigated the long-term effects of exposure to chronic unpredictable stress during adolescence on adult decision-making, coping response, cognitive bias, and exploratory behavior in rats. Rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (e.g., isolation, crowding, cage tilt) were compared to control animals that were maintained in standard, predictable conditions throughout development. Unpredictable stress during adolescence resulted in a suite of long-term behavioral and cognitive changes including a negative cognitive bias [F(1, 12) = 5.000, P {\textless} 0.05], altered coping response [T(1,14) = 2.216, P = 0.04], and accelerated decision-making [T(1,14) = 3.245, P = 0.01]. Exposure to chronic stress during adolescence also caused a short-term increase in boldness behaviors; in a novel object test 15 days after the last stressor, animals exposed to chronic unpredictable stress had decreased latencies to leave a familiar shelter and approach a novel object [T(1,14) = 2.240, P = 0.04; T(1,14) = 2.419, P = 0.03, respectively]. The results showed that stress during adolescence has long-term impacts on behavior and cognition that affect the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli, behavioral response to adverse events, and how animals make decisions.},

	abstract = {In a dot-probe task, two cues—one emotional and one neutral—are followed by a probe in one of their locations. Faster responses to probes co-located with the emotional stimulus are taken as evidence of attentional bias. Several studies indicate that such attentional bias measures have poor reliability, even though {ERP} studies show that people reliably attend to the emotional stimulus. This inconsistency might arise because the emotional stimulus captures attention briefly (as indicated by {ERP}), but cues appear for long enough that attention can be redistributed before the probe onset, causing {RT} measures of bias to vary across trials. We tested this hypothesis by manipulating {SOA} (stimulus onset asynchrony between onset of the cues and onset of the probe) in a dot-probe task using angry and neutral faces. Across three experiments, the internal reliability of behavioural biases was significantly greater than zero when probes followed faces by 100 ms, but not when the {SOA} was 300, 500, or 900 ms. Thus, the initial capture of attention shows some level of consistency, but this diminishes quickly. Even at the shortest {SOA} internal reliability estimates were poor, and not sufficient to justify the use of the task as an index of individual differences in attentional bias.},

A non-clinical sample of participants was randomly assigned to receive either {ABM} or a placebo task. To assess pre–post changes in attentional control, participants were additionally administered an emotional antisaccade task. {ABM} participants exhibited a subsequent shift in attentional bias away from threat as expected. {ABM} participants further showed a subsequent decrease in antisaccade cost, indicating a general facilitation of inhibitory attentional control.

The present study sought to examine whether such anxiety-linked attentional biases were associated with either stimulus driven or attentional control mechanisms of attentional selectivity. High and low trait anxious participants completed an emotional variant of an antisaccade task, in which they were required to prosaccade towards, or antisaccade away from a positive, neutral or threat stimulus, while eye movements were recorded. While low anxious participants were found to be slower to saccade in response to positive stimuli, irrespectively of whether a pro- or antisaccade was required, such a bias was absent in high anxious individuals. Analysis of erroneous antisaccades further revealed at trend level, that anxiety was associated with reduced peak velocity in response to threat. The findings suggest that anxiety is associated with the aberrant processing of positive stimuli, and greater compensatory efforts in the inhibition of threat. The findings further highlight the relevance of considering saccade peak velocity in the assessment of anxiety-linked attentional processing.},

	abstract = {Background: Stress plays an important role in the onset and recurrence of bipolar disorder ({BD}). Resilience is the ability to cope with stress or adversity. Few studies have examined resilience in {BD}, and this study aimed to investigate the clinical correlates of resilience in euthymic patients with {BD}.
Methods: A total of 62 outpatients with {BD} type I, {II}, and not otherwise speciﬁed ({NOS}) who were in remission and 62 healthy individuals matched with the {BD} group in terms of age and sex were recruited. All participants completed the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. A psychiatrist interviewed the subjects to assess clinical characteristics. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with resilience.
Results: The {BD} group had signiﬁcantly higher levels of impulsivity and lower levels of resilience compared with the control group. Degree of impulsivity, number of depressive episodes, Clinical Global Impression ({CGI}) scores, and length of education were signiﬁcantly correlated with resilience. Attention impulsivity, non-planning impulsivity, and number of depressive episodes were associated with low levels of resilience, even when age, sex, length of education, and {CGI} scores were controlled. Limitations: Because tertiary hospital patients were recruited, the generalizability of the ﬁndings is limited.
Conclusions: This study shows that low levels of resilience are related to high levels of impulsivity and to an increased number of depressive episodes in euthymic patients with {BD}. Given the reciprocal relationship between resilience and impulsivity, efforts to enhance resilience and reduce impulsivity may make important contributions to the treatment of patients with {BD}.},

Facilitated attention, difﬁculty in disengagement, and attentional avoidance comprise the components of attentional bias. A threat detection mechanism likely underlies facilitated attention, a process that may be neurally centered around the amygdala. Attentional control ability likely underlies difﬁculty in disengagement, emotion regulation goals likely underlie attentional avoidance, and both of these processes may be neurally centered around prefrontal cortex functioning. The threat detection mechanism may be a mostly automatic process, attentional avoidance may be a mostly strategic process, and difﬁculty in disengagement may be a mixture of automatic and strategic processing.

The study examines the association of allostatic load with environmental and psychological stress in the contexts of dementia caregiving and relinquishment of care, and is a 2-year longitudinal comparison of three groups: 80 new dementia spouse caregivers, 120 veteran caregivers, and 60 non-caregivers. Data comprised allostatic load markers and environmental and psychological stress measures. Cross-lagged analyses produced a statistically signiﬁcant association between psychological stress and one allostatic load component (primary mediators). Psychological stress was a better predictor of primary mediators than environmental stress. Primary mediators rose with time for caregivers, but not for non-caregivers. A greater rise was evident for caregivers who had relinquished their role by the second year, although the level of psychological stress actually declined. Primary mediators are a key component of the relationship between allostatic load and prior stress. When allostatic load is treated as an outcome of stress, it is important to distinguish environmental and psychological stress.},

Our findings confirm that the ease with which such a threat bias can be transiently evoked by experimental conditions that encourage its acquisition predicts the degree to which trait anxiety later becomes elevated by extended exposure to a mild stressor. Furthermore, this reflects the fact that such early measures of attentional bias plasticity predict the later naturalistic acquisition of attentional bias in response to subsequent stress, which in turn is associated with a consequent increase in trait anxiety level. These findings are consistent with our proposed account of individual differences in susceptibility to elevate trait anxiety in response to stress.},

In this paper, we first discuss how to get an idea that is worth researching. We describe sources of new ideas and how to foster a creative attitude by “cultivating your thoughts”. Only a few of these ideas will make it into a study. Next, we describe how to sharpen and focus a research question so that a study becomes feasible and a valid test of the underlying idea. To do this, the idea needs to be “pruned”. Pruning a research question means cutting away anything that is unnecessary, so that only the essence remains. This includes determining both the latent and the stated objectives, specific pruning questions, and the use of specific schemes to structure reasoning. After this, the following steps include preparation of a brief protocol, conduct of a pilot study, and writing a draft of the paper including draft tables.

The broaden-and-build theory suggests that this is because positive emotions help people build lasting resources. To test this hypothesis, the authors measured emotions daily for 1 month in a sample of students (N ϭ 86) and assessed life satisfaction and trait resilience at the beginning and end of the month. Positive emotions predicted increases in both resilience and life satisfaction. Negative emotions had weak or null effects and did not interfere with the benefits of positive emotions. Positive emotions also mediated the relation between baseline and final resilience, but life satisfaction did not. This suggests that it is in-the-moment positive emotions, and not more general positive evaluations of one’s life, that form the link between happiness and desirable life outcomes. Change in resilience mediated the relation between positive emotions and increased life satisfaction, suggesting that happy people become more satisfied not simply because they feel better but because they develop resources for living well.},

This paper reviews and synthesizes evidence for explicit (conscious) and implicit (unconscious) memory biases in the anxiety disorders. Our review suggests variations among the anxiety disorders for explicit memory biases. Specifically, there is support for explicit memory biases for threat-relevant information in panic disorder ({PD}), particularly when information has been deeply encoded, but not in social phobia ({SP}) or generalized anxiety disorder ({GAD}). The few available studies suggest the presence of explicit memory biases in posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) and obsessive – compulsive disorder ({OCD}), but further research is needed. In contrast, some degree of support for implicit memory biases has been demonstrated for each of the anxiety disorders. Inconsistencies in the existing literature, topics worthy of future research attention, and directions for revising existing information-processing models of anxiety are discussed.

First, we demonstrate the importance of variability in task scores, which in turn directly impacts reliability, particularly when comparing correlations in different populations. Second, we demonstrate the importance of variability and reliability for evaluating potential failures to replicate predicted correlations, even within the same population. Third, we demonstrate how researchers can turn to evaluating psychometric properties as a way of evaluating the feasibility of utilizing the task in new settings (e.g., online administration). Lastly, we show how the examination of psychometric properties can help researchers make informed decisions when designing a study, such as determining the appropriate number of trials for a task.},

Assessment included self-report questionnaires, as well as performance tasks measuring attentional control and working memory capacity. Combined training resulted in continued reduction in worry in the week after training, highlighting the potential of utilising n-back training as an adjunct to established clinical treatment.

This literature falls short of addressing whether the effects of {CBM}-I extend to worries about a real-life stressor, such as a school transition. Design: The study comprised a between-groups design comparing the effects of {CBM}-I to an active control ({AC}) intervention in children. Method: We recruited 38 children within two months of their primary–secondary school transition and investigated the capacity for multisession, parent-administered {CBM}-I, compared to an {AC} condition, to modify cognitive style and reduce anxiety symptoms and school concerns. Results: While benign interpretations increased signiﬁcantly and negative interpretations tended to decrease following {CBM}-I, both interventions signiﬁcantly reduced anxiety symptoms and school concerns. Conclusions: These ﬁndings indicate that anxiety-reducing effects of {CBM}-I in children extend to a real life stressful event, but that equivalent anxiety reduction may be achieved through exposure to potentially worrying situations and parent–child interaction in the absence of bias modiﬁcation.},

Using the challenge– hindrance stressor framework (Cavanaugh, Boswell, Roehling, \& Boudreau, 2000), we propose that challenge stressors have the potential to promote the capacity for resilience, whereas hindrance stressors experienced in the workplace erode resilient functioning. Employing a 2-wave longitudinal design we examined the effects of challenge and hindrance stressors on psychological resilience and strain 3 months later. Two-hundred and 8 working adults (48.1\% female) participated in both surveys. Findings indicated that Time 1 challenge stressors had a significant effect on psychological resilience 3 months later (Time 2). In contrast, Time 1 hindrance stressors positively predicted Time 2 strain and negatively predicted psychological resilience. Moreover, resilience mediated the relationship between Time 1 stressors and Time 2 strain. These results demonstrate the potential positive and negative impacts of workplace stressor types on psychological resilience, and provide an exploration of a mechanism through which challenge and hindrance stressors influence well-being. This analysis also investigated the role of resilience in moderating the relationship between hindrances and strain. Some evidence emerged for the moderating role of resilience in the hindrance–strain relationship. The implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.},

Methods. The {DASS} was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult {UK} population (N = 1,771) in terms of demographic variables. Competing models of the latent structure of the {DASS} were derived from theoretical and empirical sources and evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Correlational analysis was used to determine the influence of demographic variables on {DASS} scores. The convergent and discriminant validity of the measure was examined through correlating the measure with two other measures of depression and anxiety (the {HADS} and the {sAD}), and a measure of positive and negative affectivity (the {PANAS}).
Results. The best fitting model ({CFI} = .93) of the latent structure of the {DASS} consisted of three correlated factors corresponding to the depression, anxiety and stress scales with correlated error permitted between items comprising the {DASS} subscales. Demographic variables had only very modest influences on {DASS} scores. The reliability of the {DASS} was excellent, and the measure possessed adequate convergent and discriminant validity
Conclusions. The {DASS} is a reliable and valid measure of the constructs it was intended to assess. The utility of this measure for {UK} clinicians is enhanced by the provision of large sample normative data.},

The conventional procedures of statistical power analysis fail to provide appropriate answers to these questions because they are based on statistical models in which stimuli are not assumed to be a source of random variation in the data, models that are inappropriate for experiments involving crossed random factors of participants and stimuli. In this article, we present new methods of power analysis for designs with crossed random factors, and we give detailed, practical guidance to psychology researchers planning experiments in which a sample of participants responds to a sample of stimuli. We extensively examine 5 commonly used experimental designs, describe how to estimate statistical power in each, and provide power analysis results based on a reasonable set of default parameter values. We then develop general conclusions and formulate rules of thumb concerning the optimal design of experiments in which a sample of participants responds to a sample of stimuli. We show that in crossed designs, statistical power typically does not approach unity as the number of participants goes to infinity but instead approaches a maximum attainable power value that is possibly small, depending on the stimulus sample. We also consider the statistical merits of designs involving multiple stimulus blocks. Finally, we provide a simple and flexible Web-based power application to aid researchers in planning studies with samples of stimuli.},

	abstract = {Recent research into population standards of life satisfaction has revealed a remarkable level of uniformity, with the mean values for Western populations clustering at around three-quarters of the measurement scale maximum. While this seems to suggest the presence of a homeostatic mechanism for life satisfaction, the character of such a hypothetical device is uncertain. This paper proposes that well-being homeostasis is controlled by positive cognitive biases pertaining to the self. Most particular in this regard are the positive biases in relation to self-esteem, control and optimism. Past controversies in relation to this proposition are reviewed and resolved in favour of the proposed mechanism. The empirical data to support this hypothesis are discussed in the context of perceived well-being as an adaptive human attribute.},

The present study sought to investigate internal cognitive control impairments related to emotional information and task settings in clinical depression ({MDD}, major depressive disorder). Internal cognitive control was operationalized as switching between internally held mental representations that required continuous updating in working memory and measured with the Internal Shift Task ({IST}). The results showed that {MDD} individuals were characterized by a general switching impairment. This switching impairment was neither inﬂuenced by the task-relevance of emotional information, nor inﬂuenced by the valence of the faces within the emotion condition. The impairment in cognitive control reﬂected in general switching impairments was related to rumination, a speciﬁc cognitive symptom and important risk factor of depression. The results of this study offer new insights into the relationship between depression and impaired cognitive control with potential clinical implications, informing treatment and prevention programmes.},

	shorttitle = {Deconstructing trait anxiety},
	abstract = {Background and objectives: For decades, the dominant paradigm in trait anxiety research has regarded the construct as signifying the underlying cause of the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that supposedly reflect its presence. Recently, a network theory of personality has appeared. According to this perspective, trait anxiety is a formative construct emerging from interactions among its constitutive features (e.g., thought, feelings, behaviors); it is not a latent cause of these features. Design: In this study, we characterized trait anxiety as a network system of interacting elements.
Methods: To do so, we estimated a graphical gaussian model via the computation of a regularized partial correlation network in an unselected sample (N = 611). We also implemented modularity-based community detection analysis to test whether the features of trait anxiety cohere as a single network system.
Results: We find that trait anxiety can indeed be conceptualized as a single, coherent network system of interacting elements.
Conclusions: This radically new approach to visualizing trait anxiety may offer an especially informative view of the interplay between its constitutive features. As prior research has implicated trait anxiety as a risk factor for the development of anxiety-related psychopathology, our findings also set the scene for novel research directions.},

A double dissociation was observed. The {SERT} polymorphism altered behavioral adaptation after losses, with increased lose-shift associated with L0 homozygosity, while leaving unaffected perseveration after reversal. In contrast, the {DAT}1 genotype affected the inﬂuence of prior choices on perseveration, while leaving lose-shifting unaltered. A model of reinforcement learning captured the dose-dependent effect of {DAT}1 genotype, such that an increasing number of 9R-alleles resulted in a stronger reliance on previous experience and therefore reluctance to update learned associations. These data provide direct evidence for doubly dissociable effects of serotonin and dopamine systems.},

Positive Feelings, Negative Feelings, and the balance between the two ({SPANE}-P, N, B); and 3. Positive Thinking. The {PWB} scale is a short 8-item summary survey of the person’s self-perceived functioning in important areas such as relationships, self-esteem, purpose and meaning, and optimism. The scale is substantially correlated with other psychological well-being scales, but is briefer. The scale provides a single overall psychological well-being score and does not yield scores for various components of well-being. The Scale of Positive and Negative Experience ({SPANE}) yields a score for positive experience and feelings (6 items), a score for negative experience and feelings (6 items), and the two can be combined to create an experience balance score. This 12-item brief scale has a number of desirable features compared to earlier measures of positive and negative feelings. In particular, the scale assesses with a few items a broad range of negative and positive experiences and feelings, not just those of a certain type, and is based on the frequency of feelings during the past month. A scale to measure Positive Thinking is also presented. Basic psychometric statistics are presented for the scales based on 573 college students at ﬁve universities.},

Across the globe, the association of log income with subjective well-being was linear but convex with raw income, indicating the declining marginal effects of income on subjective well-being. Income was a moderately strong predictor of life evaluation but a much weaker predictor of positive and negative feelings. Possessing luxury conveniences and satisfaction with standard of living were also strong predictors of life evaluation. Although the meeting of basic and psychological needs mediated the effects of income on life evaluation to some degree, the strongest mediation was provided by standard of living and ownership of conveniences. In contrast, feelings were most associated with the fulfillment of psychological needs: learning, autonomy, using one’s skills, respect, and the ability to count on others in an emergency. Thus, two separate types of prosperity— economic and social psychological— best predict different types of well-being.},

	abstract = {Wellbeing is a growing area of research, yet the question of how it should be defined remains unanswered. This multi-disciplinary review explores past attempts to define wellbeing and provides an overview of the main theoretical perspectives, from the work of Aristotle to the present day. The article argues that many attempts at expressing its nature have focused purely on dimensions of wellbeing, rather than on definition. Among these theoretical perspectives, we highlight the pertinence of dynamic equilibrium theory of wellbeing (Headey \& Wearing, 1989), the effect of life challenges on homeostasis (Cummins, 2010) and the lifespan model of development (Hendry \& Kloep, 2002). Consequently, we conclude that it would be appropriate for a new definition of wellbeing to centre on a state of equilibrium or balance that can be affected by life events or challenges. The article closes by proposing this new definition, which we believe to be simple, universal in application, optimistic and a basis for measurement. This definition conveys the multi-faceted nature of wellbeing and can help individuals and policy makers move forward in their understanding of this popular term.},

	abstract = {Comorbidity among affective disorders is high. Rumination has been found to mediate cross-sectional and prospective relations between anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents and adults. We examined whether rumination and worry, both forms of repetitive negative thinking, also explain the associations between affective disorders. This was studied using a prospective cohort study. In a mixed sample of 2981 adults (persons with a prior history of or a current affective disorder and healthy individuals) we assessed {DSM}-{IV} affective disorders ({CIDI}), rumination ({LEIDS}-R) and worry ({PSWQ}). All measures were repeated 2 years and 4 years later. Using structural equation models, we found that baseline rumination and worry partly mediated the association of baseline fear disorders (social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia) with distress disorders (dysthymia, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder). Moreover, baseline fear disorders predicted changes in distress disorders and changes in worry and rumination mediated these associations. The association between baseline distress disorders and changes in fear disorders was mediated by changes in rumination but not by changes in worry. From these results it can be concluded that repetitive negative thinking is an important transdiagnostic factor. Rumination and worry are partly responsible for the cross-sectional and prospective co-occurrence of affective disorders and may be suitable targets for treatment.},

Previous research in middle childhood revealed evidence for a stronger attentional focus toward mother in children with less secure attachment expectations. However, the implication of this attentional focus for children’s exploration has not been explored. This study tested the hypothesis that this attentional focus toward mother occurs at the expense of attentional exploration of the environment. Ninety children, aged 8 –12, completed questionnaires assessing trust in maternal support, watched a video that induced mild fear of dogs, and completed a dot probe computer task assessing attentional processing of simultaneously presented pictures of mother and pictures of the threatening stimulus (i.e., dogs). Less trust in maternal support was linked to a stronger attentional focus toward the mother pictures versus the dog pictures. These results suggest that, in the presence of mother, children with more secure attachment expectations are better able to freely explore a mildly threatening environment.},

The evolutionary model contends that understanding the evolutionary functions of adolescence is critical to explaining why adolescents engage in risky behavior and that successful intervention depends on working with, instead of against, adolescent goals and motivations. The current article articulates 5 key evolutionary insights into risky adolescent behavior: (a) The adolescent transition is an inflection point in development of social status and reproductive trajectories; (b) interventions need to address the adaptive functions of risky and aggressive behaviors like bullying; (c) risky adolescent behavior adaptively calibrates over development to match both harsh and unpredictable environmental conditions; (d) understanding evolved sex differences is critical for understanding the psychology of risky behavior; and (e) mismatches between current and past environments can dysregulate adolescent behavior, as demonstrated by age-segregated social groupings. The evolutionary model has broad implications for designing interventions for high-risk youth and suggests new directions for research that have not been forthcoming from other perspectives.},

	shorttitle = {Estimating Psychological Networks and their Accuracy},
	abstract = {The usage of psychological networks that conceptualize behaviour as a complex interplay of psychological and other components has gained increasing popularity in various research ﬁelds. While prior publications have tackled the topics of estimating and interpreting such networks, little work has been conducted to check how accurate (i.e., prone to sampling variation) networks are estimated, and how stable (i.e., interpretation remains similar with less observations) inferences from the network structure (such as centrality indices) are. In this tutorial paper, we aim to introduce the reader to this ﬁeld and tackle the problem of accuracy under sampling variation. We ﬁrst introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of psychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections and centrality estimates for diﬀerent variables diﬀer from each other. We introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability coeﬃcient, and for (C) the bootstrapped diﬀerence test for edge-weights and centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in addition to the proposed bootstrap methods. We showcase bootnet in a tutorial, accompanied by R syntax, in which we analyze a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online.},

A wide variety of matrices that are used in statistics can be represented in this fashion, for example matrices that contain (implied) covariances, factor loadings, regression parameters and p values. qgraph can also be used as a psychometric tool, as it performs exploratory and conﬁrmatory factor analysis, using sem and lavaan; the output of these packages is automatically visualized in qgraph, which may aid the interpretation of results.

We describe how regularization techniques can be used to eﬃciently estimate a parsimonious and interpretable network structure on cross-sectional data. We show how to perform these analyses in R and demonstrate the method in an empirical example on post-traumatic stress disorder data. In addition, we discuss the eﬀect of the hyperparameter that needs to be manually set by the researcher, how to handle non-normal data, how to investigate the required sample size for a network analysis and provide a checklist with potential solutions for problems often arise when estimating regularized partial correlation networks.},

The remember/know/new procedure was used to classify memories as recollection-based or familiaritybased, and gaze behavior was monitored throughout the task to measure attentional allocation. We found that a bias in sustained attention during recollection-based, but not familiarity-based, retrieval predicted subsequent memory bias toward positive versus negative material following encoding. Thus, during emotional memory retrieval, attention affects controlled forms of retrieval (i.e., recollection) but does not modulate relatively automatic, familiarity-based retrieval. These findings enhance understanding of how distinct components of attention regulate the emotional content of memories. Implications for theoretical models and emotion regulation are discussed.},

	abstract = {Drawing from substantial evidence demonstrating cognitive biases in depression at various stages of information processing (i.e., attention, interpretation, memory, cognitive control), we argue for an approach that considers the interplay among these processes. This paper attempts to apply the combined cognitive bias hypothesis (Hirsch, Mathews, \& Clark, 2006) to depression research and reviews competing theoretical frameworks that have guided research in this area. We draw on current findings from behavioral studies on the interplay between depression-related processing biases. These data indicate that various cognitive biases are associated. However, it is not clear whether single or multiple biases are most predictive of depressive symptoms. We conclude this article with theoretical and clinical implications of the current state of research in this field and propose a number of ways in which research on the combined cognitive bias hypothesis can be advanced.},

It is assumed that anxiety impairs efficient functioning of the goal-directed attentional system and increases the extent to which processing is influenced by the stimulus-driven attentional system. In addition to decreasing attentional control, anxiety increases attention to threat-related stimuli. Adverse effects of anxiety on processing efficiency depend on two central executive functions involving attentional control: inhibition and shifting. However, anxiety may not impair performance effectiveness (quality of performance) when it leads to the use of compensatory strategies (e.g., enhanced effort; increased use of processing resources).

We consider whether child development has no impact on information processing biases to threat (integral bias model), or whether child development inﬂuences information processing biases and if so whether it does so by moderating the expression of an existing bias (moderation model) or by affecting the acquisition of a bias (acquisition model). We examine the extent to which these models ﬁt with existing theory and research evidence and outline some methodological issues that need to be considered when drawing conclusions about the potential role of child development in the information processing of threat stimuli.

It is not clear whether this bias is: 1) related to the physiological response to stressful events, and 2) causally related to the development of anxiety disorders.
Methods: We tested the predictive value of both preconscious and conscious attention biases in a prospective study of stress reactivity in a nonclinical sample. One hundred four male participants were assessed at baseline and then again 4 months (n ϭ 82) and 8 months later (n ϭ 70). Salivary cortisol and self-report measures were obtained at the baseline testing session in addition to measures of biased attention. Subsequent emotional reactivity was assessed by means of salivary cortisol and self-reported state-anxiety responses during a laboratorybased stressor (4 months later) as well as during a real-life stressor 8 months later (i.e., examination period).
Results: Regression analyses indicated that a preconscious negative processing bias was the best predictor of the cortisol response to stressful events. Importantly, a measure of selective processing provided a better indicator of subsequent emotional reactivity than self-report measures of neuroticism, trait-anxiety, and extraversion.
Conclusions: These results suggest that preconscious biases toward negative material play a causal role in heightened anxiety vulnerability. Our results illustrate the potential utility of preconscious biases in attention in providing an early marker of anxiety vulnerability and a potential target for treatment intervention.},

	abstract = {Background: Attention bias modiﬁcation ({ABM}) procedures have been shown to modify biased attention with important implications for emotional vulnerability and resilience. The use of {ABM} to reduce potentially toxic biases, for instance, is a newly emerging therapy for anxiety disorders. A separate line of gene-by-environment interaction research proposes that many so-called vulnerability genes or risk alleles are better seen as plasticity genes, as they seem to make individuals more susceptible to environmental inﬂuences for better and for worse.
Methods: A standard {ABM} procedure was used with a sample of 116 healthy adults. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two training groups. One received an {ABM} procedure designed to induce a bias in attention toward negative material, while the other was trained toward positive pictures. Individuals with low- and high-expressing forms of the serotonin transporter gene (5-{HTTLPR}) were compared.
Results: Those with a low-expression form (S/S, S/Lg, or Lg/Lg) of the 5-{HTTLPR} gene developed stronger biases for both negative and positive affective pictures relative to those with the high-expression (La/La) form of the gene.
Conclusions: Here, we report the ﬁrst evidence that allelic variation in the promotor region of the 5-{HTTLPR} gene predicts different degrees of sensitivity to {ABM}. These results suggest a potential cognitive mechanism for the gene-by-environment interactions that have been found in relation to the serotonin transporter gene. Variation on this genotype may therefore determine who will beneﬁt most (and least) from therapeutic interventions, adversity, and supportive environments.},

	abstract = {Gaussian graphical models with sparsity in the inverse covariance matrix are of signiﬁcant interest in many modern applications. For the problem of recovering the graphical structure, information criteria provide useful optimization objectives for algorithms searching through sets of graphs or for selection of tuning parameters of other methods such as the graphical lasso, which is a likelihood penalization technique. In this paper we establish the consistency of an extended Bayesian information criterion for Gaussian graphical models in a scenario where both the number of variables p and the sample size n grow. Compared to earlier work on the regression case, our treatment allows for growth in the number of non-zero parameters in the true model, which is necessary in order to cover connected graphs. We demonstrate the performance of this criterion on simulated data when used in conjunction with the graphical lasso, and verify that the criterion indeed performs better than either cross-validation or the ordinary Bayesian information criterion when p and the number of non-zero parameters q both scale with n.},

In an Ising model, the full conditional distributions of each variable form logistic regression models, and variable selection techniques for regression allow one to identify the neighborhood of each node and, thus, the entire graph. We prove highdimensional consistency results for this pseudo-likelihood approach to graph selection when using Bayesian information criteria for the variable selection problems in the logistic regressions. The results pertain to scenarios of sparsity, and following related prior work the information criteria we consider incorporate an explicit prior that encourages sparsity.},

	abstract = {The dot-probe task is often considered a gold standard in the ﬁeld for investigating attentional bias to threat. However, serious issues with the task have been raised. Speciﬁcally, a number of studies have demonstrated that the traditional reaction time ({RT}) measure of attentional bias to threat in the dot-probe task has poor internal reliability and poor test-retest reliability. In addition, although threatening stimuli capture attention in other paradigms, attentional bias to threat has not usually been found in typical research participants in the dot-probe task. However, when attention is measured in the dotprobe task with the N2pc component of the event-related potential waveform, substantial attentional orienting to threat is observed, and the internal reliability is moderate. To provide a rigorous comparison of the reliability of this N2pc measure and the conventional behavioral measure, as well as to examine the relationship of these measures to anxiety, the present study examined the N2pc in conjunction with {RT} in the dot-probe task in a large sample of participants (N = 96). As in previous studies, {RT} showed no bias to threatening images across the sample and exhibited poor internal reliability. Moreover, this measure did not relate to trait anxiety. By contrast, the N2pc revealed a signiﬁcant initial shift of attention to threat, and this measure was internally reliable. However, the N2pc was not correlated with trait anxiety, indicating that it does not provide a meaningful index of individual differences in anxiety in the dot-probe task. Together, these results indicate a serious need to develop new tasks and methods to more reliably investigate attentional bias to threat and its relationship to anxiety in both clinical and non-clinical populations.},

This account has been supported by a large number of studies using the {AX}-{CPT} paradigm that have demonstrated not only between-group differences, but also within-subjects variability in the use of the two control mechanisms. Yet there has been little investigation of task manipulations that can experimentally modulate the use of proactive control in healthy young adults; such manipulations could be useful to better understand the workings of cognitive control mechanisms. In the current study, a series of three experiments demonstrate how individuals can be systematically biased toward and away from the utilization of proactive control, via strategy training and no-go manipulations, respectively. These results provide increased support for the {DMC} framework, and provide a new basis from which to examine group-based differences and neural mechanisms underlying the two control modes.},

These analyses are surprisingly complex, particularly if only two waves of data are available. It is unclear for non-biostatisticians where the complexity of this analysis lies and which statistical method is adequate. With the help of simulated longitudinal data of body mass index in children, we review statistical methods for the analysis of the association between the baseline value and subsequent change, assuming linear growth with time. Key issues in such analyses are mathematical coupling, measurement error, variability of change between individuals, and regression to the mean. Ideally, it is better to rely on multiple repeated measurements at different times and a linear random effects model is a standard approach if more than two waves of data are available. If only two waves of data are available, our simulations show that Blomqvist’s method – which consists in adjusting for measurement error variance the estimated regression coefﬁcient of observed change on baseline value – provides accurate estimates. The adequacy of the methods to assess the relationship between the baseline value and subsequent change depends on the number of data waves, the availability of information on measurement error, and the variability of change between individuals.},

First, natural selection may favor risky strategies that enhance fitness on average but which have detrimental consequences for a subset of individuals. Second, mismatch may result when organisms experience environmental change during ontogeny, for instance, because they move from one environment to another. Third, organisms may learn about their environment in order to develop an appropriate phenotype; when cues indicate the environmental state probabilistically, as opposed to deterministically, sampling processes may produce mismatch. For each source of maladaptation, we present a selection of the relevant empirical research and illustrate how models from evolutionary biology can be used to make predictions about maladaptation. We also discuss what data can be collected to test these models in humans. Our goal is to show that evolutionary approaches not only yield insights into adaptive outcomes but can also illuminate the conditions leading to maladaptation. This perspective provides additional nuance to the dialectic between the developmental psychopathology model and evolutionary developmental psychology.},

In the present article, I draw recent empirical evidence together to support the continued value of computing and seeking to elevate positivity ratios. I also underscore the necessity of modeling nonlinear effects of positivity ratios and, more generally, the value of systems science approaches within affective science and positive psychology.

Results showed that this meditation practice produced increases over time in daily experiences of positive emotions, which, in turn, produced increases in a wide range of personal resources (e.g., increased mindfulness, purpose in life, social support, decreased illness symptoms). In turn, these increments in personal resources predicted increased life satisfaction and reduced depressive symptoms. Discussion centers on how positive emotions are the mechanism of change for the type of mind-training practice studied here and how loving-kindness meditation is an intervention strategy that produces positive emotions in a way that outpaces the hedonic treadmill effect.},

	abstract = {Anxiety disorders are globally prevalent, debilitating and onset in early life. Cognitive bias modiﬁcation of interpretations ({CBM}-I) training has emerged as a targeted intervention for early emerging anxiety problems. While {CBM}-I can alter interpretational styles in unselected and clinical-analogue samples of adolescents, no studies have assessed its capacity to change biases in clinical samples. Here, we assessed training efﬁcacy in ameliorating interpretation biases and anxious mood in adolescents with anxiety disorders. Twenty-eight Chinese adolescents meeting criteria for a current anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to receive positive or neutral {CBM}-I training. Training involved completing a word-fragment to resolve the outcomes of sixty ambiguous scenarios. During positive training, scenarios ended with benign/positive resolutions, but during neutral training, half of the scenarios were resolved positively and half negatively. Positively trained patients interpreted new ambiguous scenarios less negatively than the neutral training group although training effects were not observed on a questionnaire measure of interpretation bias. Training effects on mood were also absent. Before the clinical implications of {CBM}-I can be considered in adolescents, research needs to establish optimal training parameters for symptom-changes to occur.},

The etiology of these trajectories is still unclear. Individual differences in levels of negative and positive emotion are believed to play a role in determining risk and resilience following traumatic exposure. In the current investigation, we followed police officers prospectively from academy training through 48 months of active duty, assessing levels of distress every 12 months. Using latent class growth analysis, we identified 4 trajectories closely conforming to prototypical patterns. Furthermore, we found that lower levels of self-reported negative emotion during academy training prospectively predicted membership in the resilient trajectory compared with the more symptomatic trajectories following the initiation of active duty, whereas higher levels of positive emotion during academy training differentiated resilience from a trajectory that was equivalently low on distress during academy training but consistently grew in distress through 4 years of active duty. These findings emerging from a prospective longitudinal design provide evidence that resilience is predicted by both lower levels of negative emotion and higher levels of positive emotion prior to active duty stressor exposure.},

However, it is not known if this heterogeneity inﬂuences the risk for developing stress related disorders or if it is a biological consequence of the stress response itself. Determining if glucocorticoid response to stress induction prospectively predicts psychological vulnerability to signiﬁcant real life stressors can adjudicate this issue. To test this relationship, salivary cortisol as well as catecholamine responses to a laboratory stressor during academy training were examined as predictors of empirically identiﬁed distress trajectories through the subsequent 4 years of active duty among urban police ofﬁcers routinely exposed to potentially traumatic events and routine life stressors (N ¼ 234). During training, ofﬁcers were exposed to a video vignette of police ofﬁcers exposed to real-life trauma. Changes in salivary 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol ({MHPG}) and cortisol in response to this video challenge were examined as predictors of trajectory membership while controlling for age, gender, and baseline neuroendocrine levels. Ofﬁcers who followed trajectories of resilience and recovery over 4 years mounted signiﬁcant increases in cortisol in response to the experimental stressor, while those following a trajectory of chronic increasing distress had no signiﬁcant cortisol change in response to the challenge. {MHPG} responses were not associated with distress trajectories. Cortisol response prospectively differentiated trajectories of distress response suggesting that a blunted cortisol response to a laboratory stressor is a risk factor for later vulnerability to distress following signiﬁcant life stressors.},

Results indicated that Global {SWB} is predicted by Satisfaction with Life in Domains, and Positive and Negative State Affect. The cognitive dimension of {SWB} is predicted by Depression, Comparison Standards, State and Trait Affect, and several contextual variables. The affective dimension of {SWB} is predicted by Trait Affect, Depression, Anxiety, and the contextual variable of educational status. Results also indicated that intrapersonal variables are the main predictors of {SWB}, however contextual variables are also significant predictors. Each component of {SWB} (global, cognitive \& affective) shows different predictors, stressing the importance of analysing and reporting separately the results of each component.

We ﬁrst present a body of research showing that positive emotions broaden cognition and behavioral repertoires, and in so doing, build durable biopsychosocial resources that support coping and ﬂourishing mental health. Next, by explicating the processes through which momentary experiences of emotions may accrue into self-perpetuating emotional systems, the current review proposes an underlying architecture of state-trait interactions that engenders lasting affective dispositions. This theoretical framework is then used to elucidate the cognitive–emotional mechanisms underpinning three disorders of affect regulation: depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. In turn, two mind training interventions, mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation, are highlighted as means of generating positive emotions that may counter the negative affective processes implicated in these disorders. We conclude with the proposition that positive emotions may exert a countervailing force on the dysphoric, fearful, or anhedonic states characteristic of psychopathologies typiﬁed by emotional dysfunctions.},

Emotion dysregulation is a hypothesized contributor to negative outcomes and to the onset of psychopathology during adolescence. However, the dysregulation of negative emotion has been the focus of research while the literature on positive emotion in adolescent psychopathology is limited. This review highlights both the development of normative and dysregulated positive emotion during adolescence. First, the literature on normative adolescent emotional development and on negative emotional regulation is brieﬂy reviewed, followed by a discussion of current theories of positive emotion, which are grounded in the adult literature. From a developmental perspective, the dimension of approach motivation within positive emotion is emphasized throughout and frames the review. This conceptualization guides organization of literatures on normative experiences of positive emotion in adolescence and the role of dysregulated positive emotion in adolescent psychopathology, speciﬁcally adolescent depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, externalizing disorders and eating disorders. Last, future directions in the study of adolescent positive emotion and its regulation and the implications of highlighting approach motivation in normative and dysregulated positive emotion in adolescence are detailed.},

	abstract = {The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions suggests that positive emotions can widen the range of potential coping strategies that come to mind and subsequently enhance one’s resilience against stress. Studies have shown that high stress, especially chronic levels of stress, strongly contributes to the development of anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, researchers have also found that individuals who possess high levels of resilience are protected from stress and thus report lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Using a sample of 200 postdoctoral research fellows, the present study examined if (a) positive emotions were associated with greater resilience, (b) coping strategies mediated the link between positive emotions and resilience and (c) resilience moderated the inﬂuence of stress on trait anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results support the broaden-and-build theory in that positive emotions may enhance resilience directly as well as indirectly through the mediating role of coping strategies—particularly via adaptive coping. Resilience also moderated the association of stress with trait anxiety and depressive symptoms. Although stress is unavoidable and its inﬂuences on anxiety and depressive symptoms are undeniable, the likelihood of postdocs developing anxiety or depressive symptoms may be reduced by implementing programmes designed to increase positive emotions, adaptive coping strategies and resilience.

Because it has been suggested that these changes could be related to the processing of emotional information, the aim of this study was to investigate interference and inhibition towards sad and happy faces in healthy elderly people compared to a younger population. Method: We used an affective modification of the negative priming task. If interference is related to enhanced inhibition, reduced interference from negative stimuli and a related weakened inhibition towards negative stimuli in the elderly group would be in line with the positivity hypothesis. Results: As expected, the results indicated that interference from negative stimuli was significantly lower in older adults as compared to younger adults, whereas this was not the case for positive stimuli. Moreover, at inhibitory level a significantly reduced processing of negative stimuli was observed only in the older adult group, whereas there was no such effect in the case of positive material.},

The present study sought to explore the concept of ‘flourishing’ as it is constructed by students in British {HE}. An open-ended questionnaire was distributed to 222 students across two post-1992 (former polytechnic) British universities to elicit written qualitative data on their understandings of ‘flourishing’ and ‘flourishing at university’, and of their characterisations of ‘flourishing’ and ‘non-flourishing’ students. Data was content analysed using an inductive approach. Prominent categories emerging from the data sets constructed ‘flourishing’ primarily as self-actualisation (personal growth, potential realisation) and success. However, engagement (both academic and social) emerged as a significant facet of ‘flourishing at university’. The ‘flourishing student’ was characterised as academically and socially engaged, committed to learning, and oriented towards personal growth. Conversely, the ‘non-flourishing’ student emerged as having a general sense of lacking, a disengaged attitude towards academic work, and a lazy/withdrawn outlook. Results provide inductively derived support for four components of Wellbeing Theory – positive emotions, engagement, relationships, and achievement (Seligman, 2011) and allow generic understandings of ‘flourishing’ to be contextualised within a {HE} setting. Further implications of the study and suggestions for future research are discussed with regard to the findings.},

	abstract = {Cognitive theories of depression posit that people’s thoughts, inferences, attitudes, and interpretations, and the way in which they attend to and recall information, can increase their risk for depression. Three mechanisms have been implicated in the relation between biased cognitive processing and the dysregulation of emotion in depression: inhibitory processes and deﬁcits in working memory, ruminative responses to negative mood states and negative life events, and the inability to use positive and rewarding stimuli to regulate negative mood. In this review, we present a contemporary characterization of depressive cognition and discuss how different cognitive processes are related not only to each other, but also to emotion dysregulation, the hallmark feature of depression. We conclude that depression is characterized by increased elaboration of negative information, by difﬁculties disengaging from negative material, and by deﬁcits in cognitive control when processing negative information. We discuss treatment implications of these conclusions and argue that the study of cognitive aspects of depression must be broadened by investigating neural and genetic factors that are related to cognitive dysfunction in this disorder. Such integrative investigations should help us gain a more comprehensive understanding of how cognitive and biological factors interact to affect the onset, maintenance, and course of depression.},

	abstract = {In recent years there has been growing interest in determining the attentional basis of positive affectivity. Investigators have sought to evaluate the hypothesis that elevated positive affectivity is characterized by an attentional bias that favours the processing of positive information over neutral information. Unfortunately, in the studies carried out to date, the assessment procedures used by researchers to assess such attentional selectivity have either been methodologically limited or methodologically ﬂawed. Hence, the validity of the hypothesis has remained indeterminate. To overcome the problems associated with attentional assessment procedures used in previous studies, and so shed light on the attentional basis of positive affectivity, we employed an appropriate variant of the attentional probe task. Our ﬁndings show that participants high in positive affectivity displayed greater relative attention to positive information compared to neutral information, than was the case for their low positive affectivity counterparts. Thus, the present results support the hypothesis that an attentional bias to positive information, relative to neutral information, is characteristic of elevated positive affectivity.},

	abstract = {There is now reliable evidence that heightened positive affectivity is associated with a distinctive pattern of attentional selectivity, favouring emotionally positive information. While this has invited speculation that differential attentional responding to positive information may directly contribute to the determination of this emotional temperament, the causal basis of their association as yet remains unknown. We addressed this issue by experimentally manipulating selective attentional response to positive information, using a cognitive bias modiﬁcation variant of the attentional probe task, and examining the impact of this attentional manipulation on positive emotional reactivity to a subsequent success experience. The ﬁndings support the hypothesis that individual differences in selective attentional response to positive information can make a causal contribution to variation in positive affectivity.

	abstract = {Reliabilities of scores for experimental tasks are likely to differ from one study to another to the extent that the task stimuli change, the number of trials varies, the type of individuals taking the task changes, the administration conditions are altered, or the focal task variable differs. Given that reliabilities vary as a function of the design of these tasks and the characteristics of the individuals taking them, making inferences about the reliability of scores in an ongoing study based on reliability estimates from prior studies is precarious. Thus, it would be advantageous to estimate reliability based on data from the ongoing study. We argue that internal consistency estimates of reliability are underutilized for experimental task data and in many applications could provide this information using a single administration of a task. We discuss different methods for computing internal consistency estimates with a generalized coefficient alpha and the conditions under which these estimates are accurate. We illustrate use of these coefficients using data for three different tasks.},

Besides stimuli characteristics, individual characteristics such as the presence of depressive symptoms could also inﬂuence the broadening effects as depressive symptoms have previously been related to a more narrow attentional scope. Therefore, the aim of this study was to further investigate the attentional broadening effects of positive emotions, testing whether this is inﬂuenced by the emotional valence of the information presented and secondly, how the presence of depressive symptoms might interact with this relationship. We used a performance-based measure to assess ﬂuctuations in attentional broadening for positive, neutral, and negative stimuli. We assessed the presence and severity of depressive symptoms in an unselected study sample and tested whether these symptoms moderate the relationship between induced positive mood and attentional breadth for emotional information. Results showed no direct relation between positive mood and attentional breadth, regardless of the emotional valence of the stimuli. However, the presence of depressive symptoms moderated this relationship in such a way that among low levels of depressive symptoms, positive mood was related to attentional broadening speciﬁcally when positive information was presented, while at high levels of depressive symptoms this relation was reversed. The current ﬁndings suggest that both stimuli characteristics, individual characteristics and their interplay should be taken into account when investigating the broadening effects of positive emotions.},

	abstract = {Recent efforts have been made to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying psychological resilience. Cognitive flexibility in the context of affective information has been related to individual differences in resilience. However, it is unclear whether flexible affective processing is sensitive to mood fluctuations. Furthermore, it remains to be investigated how effects on flexible affective processing interact with the affective valence of information that is presented. To fill this gap, we tested the effects of positive mood and individual differences in self-reported resilience on affective flexibility, using a task switching paradigm (N ϭ 80). The main findings showed that positive mood was related to lower task switching costs, reflecting increased flexibility, in line with previous findings. In line with this effect of positive mood, we showed that greater resilience levels, specifically levels of acceptance of self and life, also facilitated task set switching in the context of affective information. However, the effects of resilience on affective flexibility seem more complex. Resilience tended to relate to more efficient task switching when negative information was preceded by positive information, possibly because the presentation of positive information, as well as positive mood, can facilitate task set switching. Positive mood also influenced costs associated with switching affective valence of the presented information. This latter effect was indicative of a reduced impact of no longer relevant negative information and more impact of no longer relevant positive information. Future research should confirm these effects of individual differences in resilience on affective flexibility, considering the affective valence of the presented information.},

	abstract = {Background—Attention Bias Modification Treatment ({ABMT}) is a newly-emerging promising treatment for anxiety disorders. While recent randomized control trials ({RCTs}) suggest that {ABMT} reduces anxiety, therapeutic effects have not been summarized quantitatively.
Methods—Standard meta-analytic procedures were used to summarize the effect of {ABMT} on anxiety. Using {MEDLINE}, January 1995 to February 2010, we identified {RCTs} comparing the effects on anxiety of {ABMT} and quantified effect sizes using Hedge’s d.
Results—Twelve studies met inclusion criteria, including 467 participants from 10 publications. {ABMT} produced significantly greater reductions in anxiety than control training, with a medium effect (d = 0.61, p {\textless}.001). Age and gender did not moderate the effect of {ABMT} on anxiety, while several characteristics of the {ABMT} training did.
Conclusions—{ABMT} shows promise as a novel treatment for anxiety. Additional {RCTs} are needed to fully evaluate the degree to which these findings replicate and apply to patients. Future work should consider the precise role for {ABMT} in the broader anxiety-disorder therapeutic armamentarium.},

	abstract = {Cognitive biases have been theorized to play a critical role in the onset and maintenance of anxiety and depression. Cognitive bias modification ({CBM}), an experimental paradigm that uses training to induce maladaptive or adaptive cognitive biases, was developed to test these causal models. Although {CBM} has generated considerable interest in the past decade, both as an experimental paradigm and as a form of treatment, there have been no quantitative reviews of the effect of {CBM} on anxiety and depression. This meta-analysis of 45 studies (2,591 participants) assessed the effect of {CBM} on cognitive biases and on anxiety and depression. {CBM} had a medium effect on biases (g ϭ 0.49) that was stronger for interpretation (g ϭ 0.81) than for attention (g ϭ 0.29) biases. {CBM} further had a small effect on anxiety and depression (g ϭ 0.13), although this effect was reliable only when symptoms were assessed after participants experienced a stressor (g ϭ 0.23). When anxiety and depression were examined separately, {CBM} significantly modified anxiety but not depression. There was a nonsignificant trend toward a larger effect for studies including multiple training sessions. These findings are broadly consistent with cognitive theories of anxiety and depression that propose an interactive effect of cognitive biases and stressors on these symptoms. However, the small effect sizes observed here suggest that this effect may be more modest than previously believed.},

Rumination was assessed at baseline in a sample of early and middle adolescents (N = 350, 6–10th graders). Symptom measures of depression, anxious arousal, general internalizing, and conduct/externalizing problems with good discriminant validity were assessed at four time points over a 5-month period. Results using hierarchical linear modeling show that rumination predicted prospective fluctuations in symptoms of depression and general internalizing problems specifically but not anxious arousal or externalizing problems. Rumination predicted increasing prospective trajectories of general internalizing symptoms. Baseline rumination interacted with prospective cooccurring fluctuations of anxious arousal and externalizing behaviors over time to predict the highest levels of prospective depressive symptoms. Rumination partly mediated the sex difference (girls {\textgreater} boys) in depressive and internalizing symptoms.},

	abstract = {Early life stress ({ELS}) is strongly associated with negative outcomes in adulthood, including reduced motivation and increased negative mood. The mechanisms mediating these relations, however, are poorly understood. We examined the relation between exposure to {ELS} and reward-related brain activity, which is known to predict motivation and mood, at age 26, in a sample followed since kindergarten with annual assessments. Using functional neuroimaging, we assayed individual differences in the activity of the ventral striatum ({VS}) during the processing of monetary rewards associated with a simple card-guessing task, in a sample of 72 male participants. We examined associations between a cumulative measure of {ELS} exposure and {VS} activity in adulthood. We found that greater levels of cumulative stress during childhood and adolescence predicted lower reward-related {VS} activity in adulthood. Extending this general developmental pattern, we found that exposure to stress early in development (between kindergarten and grade 3) was significantly associated with variability in adult {VS} activity. Our results provide an important demonstration that cumulative life stress, especially during this childhood period, is associated with blunted reward-related {VS} activity in adulthood. These differences suggest neurobiological pathways through which a history of {ELS} may contribute to reduced motivation and increased negative mood.},

	abstract = {This study considered the attentional functioning of adolescents with varying levels of pain catastrophizing. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between pain catastrophizing and attention bias to pain facial expressions. Furthermore, drawing on dual process models in the context of pain, we investigated the moderating role of attention control on this relationship. Adolescents (N 5 73; age, 16-18 years) performed a dot-probe task in which facial expressions of pain and neutral expressions were presented for 100 milliseconds and 1250 milliseconds. Participants also completed self-report pain catastrophizing and attention control measures. We found that although there was no main effect of pain catastrophizing on attention bias towards pain faces, attention control did significantly moderate this relationship. Further analysis revealed that lower levels of attention control were significantly associated with increasing attentional vigilance towards pain faces only within high catastrophizing adolescents. In addition, we found that poorer attention control was related to increased attention bias for pain faces (regardless of pain catastrophizing level) when these faces were presented for relatively longer durations (ie, 1250 milliseconds) but not for short durations (ie, 100 milliseconds). This study supports a dual process model of attentional processes in pain, thus replicating previous findings within the psychopathology literature but extending them to the study of pain. Theoretical and clinical implications of our findings are discussed.},

	abstract = {Cognitive models posit that social anxiety disorder ({SAD}) is associated with and maintained by biased attention allocation vis-à-vis social threat. However, over the last decade, there has been intense debate regarding whether {AB} in {SAD} results from preferential engagement with or difﬁculty in disengaging from social threat. Further, recent evidence suggests that {AB} may merely result from top-down attentional impairments vis-à-vis non-emotional material. Consequently, uncertainty still abounds regarding both the relative importance and the mutual interactions of these different processes and {SAD} symptoms. Inspired by novel network approaches to psychopathology that conceptualize symptoms as complex dynamic systems of mutually interacting variables, we computed weighted directed networks to investigate potential causal relations among laboratory measures of attentional components and symptoms of social anxiety disorder. Global and local connectivity of network structures revealed that the three most central variables were the orienting component of attention as well as both avoidance and fear of social situations. Neither preferential attention engagement with threat nor difﬁculty disengaging from threat exhibited high relative importance as predictors of symptoms in the network. Together, these ﬁndings suggest the value of extending the network approach beyond self-reported clinical symptoms to incorporate process-level measures from laboratory tasks to gain new insight into the mechanisms of {SAD}.},

In this meta-analysis, we assessed the efﬁcacy of {ABM} for {SAD} on symptoms, reactivity to speech challenge, attentional bias ({AB}) toward threat, and secondary symptoms at posttraining as well as {SAD} symptoms at 4-month follow-up. A systematic search in bibliographical databases uncovered 15 randomized studies involving 1043 individuals that compared {ABM} to a control training procedure. Data were extracted independently by two raters. The Q statistic was used to assess homogeneity across trials. All analyses were conducted on intent-totreat data. {ABM} produced a small but signiﬁcant reduction in {SAD} symptoms (g = 0.27), reactivity to speech challenge (g = 0.46), and {AB} (g = 0.30). These effects were moderated by characteristics of the {ABM} procedure, the design of the study, and trait anxiety at baseline. However, effects on secondary symptoms (g = 0.09) and {SAD} symptoms at 4-month follow-up (g = 0.09) were not signiﬁcant. Although there was no indication of signiﬁcant publication bias, the quality of the studies was substandard and wedged the effect sizes.

	abstract = {Recently, the disagreement that separates hedonic from eudaimonic philosophers has spread to the science of wellbeing. This has resulted in two opposing perspectives regarding both wellbeing concepts and proposed pathways to wellbeing. Whilst contention continues, most contemporary psychologists now agree that hedonic and eudaimonic approaches each denote important aspects of wellbeing. This has led to integrated wellbeing conceptualisations, in which the combined presence of hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing components is referred to as ‘flourishing’. In regard to the attainment of wellbeing, research simultaneously investigating hedonic and eudaimonic pathways suggests that a life rich in both types of pursuits is associated with the highest degree of wellbeing. Despite this assertion, previously underemphasised methodological limitations question the validity of such claims. To further progress this important area of investigation, future research directions to ameliorate said limitations are explored. It is recommended that the past tendency to contrast and compare hedonia and eudaimonia be abandoned, and instead that the inherent value of both be recognised. Time-use research methods are needed to cross-validate past findings obtained from cross-sectional research, which will make it possible to transition from purely descriptive conclusions to applied conclusions.},

To test the construct validity of the short-form version of the Depression anxiety and stress scale ({DASS}-21), and in particular, to assess whether stress as indexed by this measure is synonymous with negative affectivity ({NA}) or whether it represents a related, but distinct, construct. To provide normative data for the general adult population. Design. Cross-sectional, correlational and conﬁrmatory factor analysis ({CFA}).
Methods. The {DASS}-21 was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult {UK} population (N ¼ 1; 794). Competing models of the latent structure of the {DASS}-21 were evaluated using {CFA}.
Results. The model with optimal ﬁt ({RCFI} ¼ 0.94) had a quadripartite structure, and consisted of a general factor of psychological distress plus orthogonal speciﬁc factors of depression, anxiety, and stress. This model was a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt than a competing model that tested the possibility that the Stress scale simply measures {NA}.
Conclusions. The {DASS}-21 subscales can validly be used to measure the dimensions of depression, anxiety, and stress. However, each of these subscales also taps a more general dimension of psychological distress or {NA}. The utility of the measure is enhanced by the provision of normative data based on a large sample.},

High interview anxious volunteers were allocated to read descriptions of job interviews, either taking their own perspective in the described situation or that of a conﬁdent interviewee. At certain points during the text, a target letter string appeared and participants were asked to indicate whether it formed a word or a non-word (lexical decision). Some of the lexical decisions occurred in the context of ambiguous text that could be interpreted in both a threatening and a benign manner. In a baseline condition, decisions were made following text for which there was only one possible inference (either threat or benign).

The current experiment investigated the converse possibility: that inducing an inferential bias can change the content of self-related images. The effects of repeated practice in accessing either negative or positive social outcomes was tested by having participants report on self-images generated during subsequent experience with ambiguous social situations. Participants and independent judges rated the content of participants’ self-images as being more negative after prior practice in accessing negative rather than positive social outcomes. Furthermore, participants who practiced accessing negative outcomes rated their anticipated anxiety in an imagined stressful social situation as being greater, and their expected social performance as poorer than participants in the positive outcome group. Groups did not differ in state anxiety levels when making their ratings, so it is unlikely that any observed differences between groups can be attributed to mood effects. We suggest that this ﬁnding is consistent with the hypothesis that inferential biases and content of self-images can interact with each other and may together serve to maintain social anxiety.},

	abstract = {Objectives. Overgeneral autobiographical memory ({OGM}) refers to the impaired retrieval of speciﬁc events from autobiographical memory. This review examined {OGM} in children and adolescents to answer three main questions. First, do children demonstrate {OGM}? Second, how does the experience of {OGM} relate to childhood trauma and associated psychopathology? Third, is the {CaR}-{FA}-X model (Williams et al., 2007) able to explain {OGM} in child psychopathology once developmental issues have been considered?
Method. Articles were identiﬁed in {PsycINFO} and {PubMed} searches using the terms overgeneral memory {AND} children, autobiographical memory speciﬁcity {AND} children, and autobiographical memory {AND} children. The authors reviewed 21 articles that examined {OGM} in young people aged 7–18 years. Effect sizes were calculated for each study.
Results. The review demonstrated consistent support for a relationship with trauma exposure and depression symptoms in childhood. Furthermore, {OGM} was found to predict depression symptoms. Limited support was provided for the efﬁcacy of the {CaR}-{FA}-X model in young people.
Conclusions. Future research will need to examine the inﬂuence of trauma characteristics on {OGM} development, along with the relationship of {OGM} to depression prognosis. Further investigation of the {CaR}-{FA}-X model is required and developmental aspects will need to be taken into account.},

Novel approaches to studying stress-related disorders focus increasingly on trophic factor signaling in corticolimbic circuits that both mediate and regulate cognitive, behavioral, and physiological responses to deleterious stress. Recent evidence demonstrates that the neural plasticity supported by these trophic mechanisms is vital for establishing and maintaining resilience to stress. Therapeutic interventions that promote these mechanisms, be they pharmacological, behavioral, or environmental, may therefore prevent or reverse stress-related mental illness by enhancing resilience. The present paper will provide an overview of trophic mechanisms responsible for the enhancement of resilience by voluntary exercise with an emphasis on brain-derived neurotrophic factor, galanin, and interactions between these two trophic factors.},

	shorttitle = {Measuring flourishing},
	abstract = {The epidemiology of flourishing is an important research topic prompting international interest in its psychometric assessment. But the need to measure human feelings and functioning at the population level has resulted in the creation of a multitude of different conceptual frameworks of flourishing: a term now commonly used to describe high levels of subjective wellbeing. Not only do different researchers theorise and conceptualise flourishing in different ways, but also the categorical diagnosis of flourishing is dependent upon the various combinations of components, and researcher-determined thresholds, used in each operationalization. The multiplicity of approaches is potentially limiting the usefulness of the resultant epidemiology. This paper comprises two parts: Part 1 identifies four operationalizations of flourishing in the psychology literature and reviews their psychometric properties and utility; Part 2 investigates the impact of operational definition on the prevalence of flourishing using the Sovereign Wellbeing Index survey, a sample of 10,009 adult New Zealanders, and reports substantial variation in prevalence rates according to the four different operationalizations: Huppert and So (24\%), Keyes (39\%), Diener et al. (41\%) and Seligman et al. (47\%). Huppert and So’s model was the only one of the four to require endorsement of one particular variable, making it the most stringent criterion for flourishing, while the other three were more flexible in their categorisation. Cross-tabulation analysis indicated strong agreement between our replications of Keyes and Seligman et al.’s models (81\%), and between Diener et al. and Seligman et al.’s models (80\%). Agreement between Seligman, and Huppert and So’s, operationalizations was moderate (74\%). Taken together, and in line with recent {OECD} recommendations, our findings reinforce the need for greater international collaboration and conceptualisation consensus when measuring flourishing. In the absence of any published empirical research investigating perceptions of flourishing among laypersons, a prototype analysis investigating alignment between lay and academic conceptualisations of flourishing is recommended.},

Literature suggests that cognitive control training ({CCT}) targeting working memory functioning can increase effectiveness of existing antidepressant treatments to reduce rumination. However, it remains unclear whether {CCT} can also be implemented as a preventive intervention for depression, increasing resilience. For this purpose, at-risk undergraduate students (high trait ruminators) were allocated to a {CCT} or active control condition, consisting of 10 online training sessions. Working memory functioning was assessed preceding and following the training and reactivity to a lab stressor was assessed directly following training. Finally, at four weeks follow-up, brooding e the maladaptive form of rumination e was re-assessed in response to a naturalistic stressor (examination period). Although we did not ﬁnd direct transfer effects of {CCT} on working memory functioning, increase in working memory functioning following {CCT} was related to post-training brooding and resilience levels. Moreover, participants receiving {CCT} demonstrated lower stress reactivity in the lab and a decrease in brooding following a naturalistic stressor at follow-up, indicating temporal stability of our ﬁndings. These ﬁndings suggest that {CCT} can be considered a promising preventive intervention to reduce stress reactivity and rumination.},

Several cognitive risk- and resilience factors have been suggested to account for this vulnerability. In the current study we explored how risk- and protective factors such as cognitive control, adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation, residual symptomatology, and resilience relate to one another in a remitted depressed ({RMD}) sample.
Methods: We examined the relationships between these constructs in a cross-sectional dataset of 69 {RMD} patients using network analyses in order to obtain a comprehensive, data-driven view on the interplay between these constructs. We subsequently present an association network, a concentration network, and a relative importance network.
Results: In all three networks resilience formed the central hub, connecting perceived cognitive control (i.e., working memory complaints), emotion regulation, and residual symptomatology. The contribution of the behavioral measure for cognitive control in the network was negligible. Moreover, the directed relative importance network indicates bidirectional inﬂuences between these constructs, with all indicators of centrality suggesting a key role of resilience in remission from depression. Limitations: The presented ﬁndings are cross-sectional and networks are limited to a ﬁxed set of key constructs in the literature pertaining cognitive vulnerability for depression.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings indicate the importance of resilience to successfully cope with stressors following remission from depression. Further in-depth studies will be essential to identify the speciﬁc underlying resilience mechanisms that may be key to successful remission from depression.},

	abstract = {Governments around the world are recognising the importance of measuring subjective well-being as an indicator of progress. But how should well-being be measured? A conceptual framework is offered which equates high well-being with positive mental health. Well-being is seen as lying at the opposite end of a spectrum to the common mental disorders (depression, anxiety). By examining internationally agreed criteria for depression and anxiety ({DSM} and {ICD} classiﬁcations), and deﬁning the opposite of each symptom, we identify ten features of positive well-being. These combine feeling and functioning, i.e. hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of well-being: competence, emotional stability, engagement, meaning, optimism, positive emotion, positive relationships, resilience, self esteem, and vitality. An operational deﬁnition of ﬂourishing is developed, based on psychometric analysis of indicators of these ten features, using data from a representative sample of 43,000 Europeans. Application of this deﬁnition to respondents from the 23 countries which participated in the European Social Survey (Round 3) reveals a four-fold difference in ﬂourishing rate, from 41\% in Denmark to less than 10\% in Slovakia, Russia and Portugal. There are also striking differences in country proﬁles across the 10 features. These proﬁles offer fresh insight into cultural differences in well-being, and indicate which features may provide the most promising targets for policies to improve well-being. Comparison with a life satisfaction measure shows that valuable information would be lost if well-being was measured by life satisfaction. Taken together, our ﬁndings reinforce the need to measure subjective well-being as a multi-dimensional construct in future surveys.},

In multiple regression, strengths usually related more to positive well-being—life satisfaction, positive affect, vitality, meaning, elevating experience—though vulnerabilities also related to the ﬁrst three variables; vulnerabilities related more to illbeing—negative affect, depression—though hope, humor, enthusiasm, and forgiveness sometimes also showed relationships. Pre-treatment strengths (hope, spirituality, appreciation of beauty and excellence) predicted post-treatment recovery from depression; cognitive vulnerabilities did not. Strengths and vulnerabilities sometimes interacted, with strengths weakening the relationship between vulnerabilities and well-being.

Overall, results indicated that: between persons (at the trait level) and within persons (at the momentary state level), hedonic pursuits related more to positive affect and carefreeness, while eudaimonic pursuits related more to meaning; between persons, eudaimonia related more to elevating experience (awe, inspiration, and sense of connection with a greater whole); within persons, hedonia related more negatively to negative affect; between and within persons, both pursuits related equally to vitality; and both pursuits showed some links with life satisfaction, though hedonia’s links were more frequent. People whose lives were high in both eudaimonia and hedonia had: higher degrees of most well-being variables than people whose lives were low in both pursuits (but did not differ in negative affect or carefreeness); higher positive affect and carefreeness than predominantly eudaimonic individuals; and higher meaning, elevating experience, and vitality than predominantly hedonic individuals. In the intervention study, hedonia produced more well-being beneﬁts at short-term follow-up, while eudaimonia produced more at 3-month follow-up.

When using identical model specifications, as in prior studies, we found that resilient trajectories were most common, but the number of trajectories identified was different. When we relaxed two assumptions used in prior studies—that (a) all classes have similar variability in levels of postadversity adjustment and (b) there is no variability in changes within classes—we found that a resilience class was least common. Methodologically, our results show how findings on trajectories of change following major life stressors can vary substantially, depending on statistical model specifications. Conceptually, the results underscore the errors inherent in any categorical statements about “rates of resilience” among individuals confronted with major life stressors. Pragmatically, they underscore the dangers in recommending against prophylactic interventions (on the basis of one method of analyzing longitudinal data) for individuals who have experienced major life stressors.},

	abstract = {Researchers have theorized that changing the way we think about our bodily responses can improve our physiological and cognitive reactions to stressful events. However, the underlying processes through which mental states improve downstream outcomes are not well understood. To this end, we examined whether reappraising stress-induced arousal could improve cardiovascular outcomes and decrease attentional bias for emotionally negative information. Participants were randomly assigned to either a reappraisal condition in which they were instructed to think about their physiological arousal during a stressful task as functional and adaptive, or to 1 of 2 control conditions: attention reorientation and no instructions. Relative to controls, participants instructed to reappraise their arousal exhibited more adaptive cardiovascular stress responses—increased cardiac efficiency and lower vascular resistance—and decreased attentional bias. Thus, reappraising arousal shows physiological and cognitive benefits. Implications for health and potential clinical applications are discussed.},

Evidence consistent with the proposition that individuals differ in plasticity is reviewed. The authors document multiple instances in which (a) phenotypic temperamental characteristics, (b) endophenotypic attributes, and (c) specific genes function less like “vulnerability factors” and more like “plasticity factors,” thereby rendering some individuals more malleable or susceptible than others to both negative and positive environmental influences. Discussion focuses upon limits of the evidence, statistical criteria for distinguishing differential susceptibility from diathesis stress, potential mechanisms of influence, and unknowns in the differentialsusceptibility equation.},

	abstract = {The visual probe task ({VPT}) is a computerized task used to measure attentional bias to substancerelated stimuli. Little research has examined the psychometric properties of the {VPT}, despite concerns it demonstrates poor test–retest reliability and internal consistency. These issues can reduce confidence in inferences based on {VPT} performance. As such, we attempted to identify parameters under which the reliability of the alcohol {VPT} might be improved by applying recent empirical recommendations for outlier handling, bias calculation, and task design from the anxiety literature. We reanalyzed data from 3 previously published studies in our laboratory and 2 newly collected data sets. We compared tasks which presented images on the left/right of the screen to above/below, whether participants responded to the location or content of the probe, and whether general alcohol-related images or images personalized to the individual were used. In each {VPT} we also applied a priori outlier removal (2 and 3 standard deviations and median absolute difference) and data-driven outlier removal (winsorizing), in addition to calculating trial-level bias scores. Across all studies and tasks internal consistency and test–retest reliability of attentional bias measures were inadequate. There was no consistent improvement in internal consistency or test–retest reliability as a function of outlier removal methods. We were unable to demonstrate adequate reliability of the alcohol {VPT}, which further supports observations that these tasks may not yield reliable measures. Future research should focus on improving the reliability of these tasks or abandoning them in favor of more reliable alternatives.},

	shorttitle = {Neural Mechanisms Underlying the Cost of Task Switching},
	abstract = {Background: When switching from one task to a new one, reaction times are prolonged. This phenomenon is called switch cost ({SC}). Researchers have recently used several kinds of task-switching paradigms to uncover neural mechanisms underlying the {SC}. Task-set reconfiguration and passive dissipation of a previously relevant task-set have been reported to contribute to the cost of task switching.
Methodology/Principal Findings: An unpredictable cued task-switching paradigm was used, during which subjects were instructed to switch between a color and an orientation discrimination task. Electroencephalography ({EEG}) and behavioral measures were recorded in 14 subjects. Response-stimulus interval ({RSI}) and cue-stimulus interval ({CSI}) were manipulated with short and long intervals, respectively. Switch trials delayed reaction times ({RTs}) and increased error rates compared with repeat trials. The {SC} of {RTs} was smaller in the long {CSI} condition. For cue-locked waveforms, switch trials generated a larger parietal positive event-related potential ({ERP}), and a larger slow parietal positivity compared with repeat trials in the short and long {CSI} condition. Neural {SC} of cue-related {ERP} positivity was smaller in the long {RSI} condition. For stimuluslocked waveforms, a larger switch-related central negative {ERP} component was observed, and the neural {SC} of the {ERP} negativity was smaller in the long {CSI}. Results of standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography ({sLORETA}) for both {ERP} positivity and negativity showed that switch trials evoked larger activation than repeat trials in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({DLPFC}) and posterior parietal cortex ({PPC}).
Conclusions/Significance: The results provide evidence that both {RSI} and {CSI} modulate the neural activities in the process of task-switching, but that these have a differential role during task-set reconfiguration and passive dissipation of a previously relevant task-set.},

The application of traditional analytic methods to the data from such studies can result in serious bias in testing experimental effects. In this review, we develop a comprehensive typology of designs involving two random factors, which may be either crossed or nested, and one ﬁxed factor, condition. We present appropriate linear mixed models for all designs and develop effect size measures. We provide the tools for power estimation for all designs. We then discuss issues of design choice, highlighting power and feasibility considerations.

	abstract = {The well-replicated observation that many people maintain mental health despite exposure to severe psychological or physical adversity has ignited interest in the mechanisms that protect against stress-related mental illness. Focusing on resilience rather than pathophysiology in many ways represents a paradigm shift in clinical-psychological and psychiatric research that has great potential for the development of new prevention and treatment strategies. More recently, research into resilience also arrived in the neurobiological community, posing nontrivial questions about ecological validity and translatability. Drawing on concepts and ﬁndings from transdiagnostic psychiatry, emotion research, and behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, we propose a uniﬁed theoretical framework for the neuroscientiﬁc study of general resilience mechanisms. The framework is applicable to both animal and human research and supports the design and interpretation of translational studies. The theory emphasizes the causal role of stimulus appraisal (evaluation) processes in the generation of emotional responses, including responses to potential stressors. On this basis, it posits that a positive (non-negative) appraisal style is the key mechanism that protects against the detrimental effects of stress and mediates the effects of other known resilience factors. Appraisal style is shaped by three classes of cognitive processes – positive situation classiﬁcation, reappraisal, and interference inhibition – that can be investigated at the neural level. Prospects for the future development of resilience research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Executive functions ({EFs}) include a number of higher-level cognitive control abilities, such as cognitive ﬂexibility, inhibition, and working memory, which are instrumental in supporting action control and the ﬂexible adaptation changing environments. These control functions are supported by the prefrontal cortex and therefore develop rapidly across childhood and mature well into late adolescence. Given that executive control is a strong predictor for various life outcomes, such as academic achievement, socioeconomic status, and physical health, numerous training interventions have been designed to improve executive functioning across the lifespan, many of them targeting children and adolescents. Despite the increasing popularity of these trainings, their results are neither robust nor consistent, and the transferability of training-induced performance improvements to untrained tasks seems to be limited. In this review, we provide a selective overview of the developmental literature on process-based cognitive interventions by discussing (1) the concept and the development of {EFs} and their neural underpinnings, (2) the effects of different types of executive control training in normally developing children and adolescents, (3) individual differences in training-related performance gains as well as (4) the potential of cognitive training interventions for the application in clinical and educational contexts. Based on recent ﬁndings, we consider how transfer of process-based executive control trainings may be supported and how interventions may be tailored to the needs of speciﬁc age groups or populations.},

Three age groups (8–10; 18–26; 62–76 years of age) were examined in a pretest-training-posttest design. We found near transfer of task-switching training in all age groups, especially in children and older adults. Near transfer was enhanced in adults and impaired in children when training tasks were variable.

Without disputing their importance, these foci fail to capture many of the ﬂuctuating, conﬂicting forces that are readily apparent when people navigate the environment and social world. In this paper, we review literature to offer evidence for the prominence of psychological ﬂexibility in understanding psychological health. Thus far, the importance of psychological ﬂexibility has been obscured by the isolation and disconnection of research conducted on this topic. Psychological ﬂexibility spans a wide range of human abilities to: recognize and adapt to various situational demands; shift mindsets or behavioral repertoires when these strategies compromise personal or social functioning; maintain balance among important life domains; and be aware, open, and committed to behaviors that are congruent with deeply held values. In many forms of psychopathology, these ﬂexibility processes are absent. In hopes of creating a more coherent understanding, we synthesize work in emotion regulation, mindfulness and acceptance, social and personality psychology, and neuropsychology. Basic research ﬁndings provide insight into the nature, correlates, and consequences of psychological ﬂexibility and applied research provides details on promising interventions. Throughout, we emphasize dynamic approaches that might capture this ﬂuid construct in the real-world.},

Methods: Data from the 1998 National Health Interview Survey were linked to prospective National Death Index mortality data through 2006. Separate logistic regression models were used to examine the factors associated with current health status and psychological distress. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the impact of perceiving that stress affects health on all-cause mortality. Each model specifically examined the interaction between the amount of stress and the perception that stress affects health, controlling for sociodemographic, health behavior, and access to health care factors. Results: 33.7\% of nearly 186 million (unweighted n ϭ 28,753) U.S. adults perceived that stress affected their health a lot or to some extent. Both higher levels of reported stress and the perception that stress affects health were independently associated with an increased likelihood of worse health and mental health outcomes. The amount of stress and the perception that stress affects health interacted such that those who reported a lot of stress and that stress impacted their health a lot had a 43\% increased risk of premature death ({HR} ϭ 1.43, 95\% {CI} [1.2, 1.7]). Conclusions: High amounts of stress and the perception that stress impacts health are each associated with poor health and mental health. Individuals who perceived that stress affects their health and reported a large amount of stress had an increased risk of premature death.},

However, studies do not include a comprehensive assessment that reﬂects eudaimonic as well as hedonic {SWB}. We revisit the question of {SWB}’s complete overlap with personality employing the tripartite model—emotional, psychological, and social—of {SWB} that, together, reﬂect Keyes’ (2002) model of ﬂourishing. Data are from the Midlife in the United States national sample of 1,386 twins. Analyses were done using Mx to test Cholesky decomposition models and a two latent factor common pathway model. Onethird of the total (72 \%) heritability of ﬂourishing and 40 \% of its environmental variability are distinct from the big-ﬁve personality traits. We also ﬁnd a low phenotypic association (mean r = .22) between the three dimensions of {SWB} and big-ﬁve personality traits despite substantial shared genetic etiology. In addition to non-trivial amounts of distinctive genetic and environmental variance and low phenotypic correlation, we point to limited investigation of reciprocal causation of {SWB} and personality. Psychologist should not yet conclude that {SWB} is a ‘personality thing’ anymore than personality might be a ‘wellbeing thing’.},

Methods. In 2009, we analyzed data from the 1995 and 2005 Midlife in the United States cross-sectional surveys (n = 1723), which measured positive mental health and 12-month mental disorders of major depressive episode, panic, and generalized anxiety disorders.
Results. Population prevalence of any of 3 mental disorders and levels of mental health appeared stable but were dynamic at the individual level. Fifty-two percent of the 17.5\% of respondents with any mental illness in 2005 were new cases; one half of those languishing in 1995 improved in 2005, and one half of those ﬂourishing in 1995 declined in 2005. Change in mental health was strongly predictive of prevalence and incidence (operationalized as a new, not necessarily a ﬁrst, episode) of mental illness in 2005.
Conclusions. Gains in mental health predicted declines in mental illness, supporting the call for public mental health promotion; losses of mental health predicted increases in mental illness, supporting the call for public mental health protection.

Heritability for the latent ‘‘mental well-being’’ factor was high (72\%) and best indexed by psychological well-being. Moderate trait-speciﬁc genetic effects were seen for emotional and social well-being. Nonshared environmental effects for all measures were mostly trait speciﬁc.
Conclusions. Genetic inﬂuences on the measures of mental well-being reﬂect a single, highly heritable genetic factor, although some trait-speciﬁc genetic inﬂuences were seen for emotional and social well-being. Moderate proportions of environmental inﬂuences were also shared, but the majority of unique environment was trait-speciﬁc. (Am J Public Health. 2010;100:2379–2384. doi: 10.2105/{AJPH}.2010.193615)},

Methods. Data were from the Midlife in the United States ({MIDUS}) study (n = 3032), which at baseline in 1995 measured positive mental health (ﬂourishing and not) and past-year mental illness (major depressive episode, panic attacks, and generalized anxiety disorders), and linked respondents with National Death Index records in a 10-year follow-up ending in 2005. Covariates were age, gender, race, education, any past-year mental illness, smoking, physical inactivity, physical diseases, and physical disease risk factors.
Results. A total of 6.3\% of participants died during the study period. The ﬁnal and fully adjusted odds ratio of mortality was 1.62 (95\% conﬁdence interval [{CI}] = 1.00, 2.62; P = .05) for adults who were not ﬂourishing, relative to participants with ﬂourishing mental health. Age, gender, race, education, smoking, physical inactivity, cardiovascular disease, and {HIV}/{AIDS} were signiﬁcant predictors of death during the study period.
Conclusions. The absence of positive mental health increased the probability of all-cause mortality for men and women at all ages after adjustment for known causes of death. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:2164–2172. doi:10.2105/{AJPH}. 2012.300918)},

	abstract = {The past decade has witnessed an exponential growth in studies that have attempted to identify the genetic polymporphisms that moderate the influence of environmental risks on mental disorders. What tends to be neglected in these {GeneÂ} Environment ({GÂ} E) interaction studies has been a focus on resilience, which refers to a dynamic pattern of positive adaptation despite the experience of a significant trauma or adversity. In this article, we argue that one step toward advancing the field of developmental psychopathology would be for G Â E research to consider resilience instead of focusing almost exclusively on mental disorders. After providing an up-to-date summary on the expanding definitions and models of resilience, and the available evidence regarding measured G Â E studies of childhood maltreatment, we discuss why resilience would be a worthwhile phenotype for studies of measured G Â E. First, although G Â E hypotheses require that there be an environmental risk (e-risk) involved in a causal process that leads to psychopathology, e-risks are typically not included in the diagnostic criteria for most psychiatric disorders. In contrast, resilience by definition includes an e-risk. Second, {GÂE} hypotheses require that there is evidence of variability in response to an environmental stressor, and resilience often represents the positive end on this continuum of adaptation. Third, both resilience and G Â E are best understood from a developmental perspective. Fourth, although resilient outcomes are not public health concerns, the types of adversities (e.g., childhood maltreatment, poverty, or exposure to natural disasters) that are often investigated in studies of resilience certainly are. Understanding how some individuals, perhaps because of their genetic makeup, are able to withstand such adversities can inform prevention and intervention efforts to improve mental health.},

In this article, we review the findings of research examining attention to and memory for negative emotional information using a more dimensional perspective on depression. Specifically, we explore studies that assess cognitive biases along a continuum of depressive symptom severity and consider the influence of co-occurring dimensions of functioning, in particular the severity of anxiety symptoms.

A total of 681 adolescents performed a Dot Probe Task ({DPT}), an Emotional Visual Search Task ({EVST}), and an Interpretation Recognition Task. Attention and interpretation biases were significantly correlated with anxiety. Mixed results were reported with regard to depression: evidence was found for an interpretation bias, and for an attention bias as measured with the {EVST} but not with the {DPT}. Furthermore, interpretation and attention biases predicted unique variance in anxiety and depression scores. These results indicate that attention and interpretation biases are unique processes in anxiety and depression. They also suggest that anxiety and depression are partly based on similar underlying cognitive mechanisms.},

Training yielded some improvement in performance on the numerosity-discrimination task, but only in older adolescents or adults. In contrast, training in relational reasoning improved performance on that task in all age groups, but training benefits were greater for people in late adolescence and adulthood than for people earlier in adolescence. Training did not increase performance on the face-perception task for any age group.

In this study, 44 undergraduates performed a pictorial version of the probe detection task. Taking into account the reaction times on neutral trials, we found no evidence for a facilitated detection of threatening information. It was found that the dot probe eﬀects are at least partially due to disengagement eﬀects.

	abstract = {The ability to flexibly switch attention between emotional and non-emotional information in working memory is considered important in stress-resilience and is impaired in mood disorders. A recent theory claims that this component of attention is specifically related to ruminative thought. To further investigate this claim we report two new experiments using the internal shift task ({IST}). In experiment 1 (N=27) we examined the stability of switching ability measured using the {IST} through examination of internal consistency (stability within the task) and test-retest-reliability (stability over time) over two weeks. Results indicate relatively high stability of switching ability measured with the {IST}. In experiment 2 the {IST} was administered to a pre-selected undergraduate sample of high (N=20) and low ruminators (N=20). The main findings were that rumination was related to attentional switching impairments, specifically in the context of emotional information. The switching impairments were most pronounced when negative information was held in working memory. The attentional switching impairments were most strongly related to the depressive brooding component of rumination. The results of this study lend further support to the proposed link between rumination and switching abilities.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.
{MEASUREMENTS}: The Patient Health Questionnaire ({PHQ}) is a self-administered version of the {PRIME}-{MD} diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The {PHQ}-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 {DSM}-{IV} criteria as ``0'' (not at all) to ``3'' (nearly every day). The {PHQ}-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, selfreported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional ({MHP}) interview in a sample of 580 patients.
{RESULTS}: As {PHQ}-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 {SF}-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the {MHP} reinterview as the criterion standard, a {PHQ}-9 score !10 had a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 88\% for major depression. {PHQ}-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.
{CONCLUSION}: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the {PHQ}-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the {PHQ}-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

	shorttitle = {Capturing Dynamics of Biased Attention},
	abstract = {Background New indices, calculated on data from the widely used Dot Probe Task, were recently proposed to capture variability in biased attention allocation. We observed that it remains unclear which data pattern is meant to be indicative of dynamic bias and thus to be captured by these indices. Moreover, we hypothesized that the new indices are sensitive to {SD} differences at the response time ({RT}) level in the absence of bias.
Method Randomly generated datasets were analyzed to assess properties of the Attention Bias Variability ({ABV}) and Trial Level Bias Score ({TL}-{BS}) indices. Sensitivity to creating differences in 1) {RT} standard deviation, 2) mean {RT}, and 3) bias magnitude were assessed. In addition, two possible definitions of dynamic attention bias were explored by creating differences in 4) frequency of bias switching, and 5) bias magnitude in the presence of constant switching.
Results {ABV} and {TL}-{BS} indices were found highly sensitive to increasing {SD} at the response time level, insensitive to increasing bias, linearly sensitive to increasing bias magnitude in the presence of bias switches, and non-linearly sensitive to increasing the frequency of bias switches. The {ABV} index was also found responsive to increasing mean response times in the absence of bias.
Conclusion Recently proposed {DPT} derived variability indices cannot uncouple measurement error from bias variability. Significant group differences may be observed even if there is no bias present in any individual dataset. This renders the new indices in their current form unfit for empirical purposes. Our discussion focuses on fostering debate and ideas for new research to validate the potentially very important notion of biased attention being dynamic.},

It draws attention to the work of {McNaught} (2011). He has developed a definitional framework of wellbeing, in which wellbeing is perceived to be a macro concept or area of study concerned with the objective and subjective assessment of wellbeing as a desirable human state. The framework broadens wellbeing to a range of different domains beyond individual subjectivity, which has been the traditional focus of concern, and extracts it from customary affiliations with health to incorporate the family, community and society as a whole. The framework reflects the conceptual complexity of ‘wellbeing’ and highlights its dependency upon a range of social, economic and environmental forces that provide the resources and the contexts for the generation and maintenance of wellbeing at all levels of society. The article argues that the framework provides a paradigm that facilitates further development and systemisation of research and knowledge in the field of wellbeing. Firstly, the framework has the capacity to bring some clarity, inclusiveness and holism to research and practice. Secondly, it is useful as a tool to enhance theoretical frameworks and to guide the design and development of both health and wellbeing interventions. Thirdly, it provides the philosophical underpinnings for wellbeing policy development.},

The method established itself after the appearance of three seminal studies (Hess \& Polt, 1960, 1964; Kahneman \& Beatty, 1966). Since then, the method has continued to play a significant role within the field, and pupillary responses have been successfully used to provide an estimate of the “intensity” of mental activity and of changes in mental states, particularly changes in the allocation of attention and the consolidation of perception. Remarkably, pupillary responses provide a continuous measure regardless of whether the participant is aware of such changes. More recently, research in neuroscience has revealed a tight correlation between the activity of the locus coeruleus (i.e., the “hub” of the noradrenergic system) and pupillary dilation.As we discuss in this short review, these neurophysiological findings provide new important insights to the meaning of pupillary responses for mental activity. Finally, given that pupillary responses can be easily measured in a noninvasive manner, occur from birth, and can occur in the absence of voluntary, conscious processes, they constitute a very promising tool for the study of preverbal (e.g., infants) or nonverbal participants (e.g., animals, neurological patients).},

	shorttitle = {On the reproducibility of meta-analyses},
	abstract = {Background: Meta-analyses play an important role in cumulative science by combining information across multiple studies and attempting to provide effect size estimates corrected for publication bias. Research on the reproducibility of meta-analyses reveals that errors are common, and the percentage of effect size calculations that cannot be reproduced is much higher than is desirable. Furthermore, the flexibility in inclusion criteria when performing a meta-analysis, combined with the many conflicting conclusions drawn by meta-analyses of the same set of studies performed by different researchers, has led some people to doubt whether meta-analyses can provide objective conclusions. Discussion: The present article highlights the need to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses to facilitate the identification of errors, allow researchers to examine the impact of subjective choices such as inclusion criteria, and update the meta-analysis after several years. Reproducibility can be improved by applying standardized reporting guidelines and sharing all meta-analytic data underlying the meta-analysis, including quotes from articles to specify how effect sizes were calculated. Pre-registration of the research protocol (which can be peer-reviewed using novel ‘registered report’ formats) can be used to distinguish a-priori analysis plans from data-driven choices, and reduce the amount of criticism after the results are known. Summary: The recommendations put forward in this article aim to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses. In addition, they have the benefit of “future-proofing” meta-analyses by allowing the shared data to be re-analyzed as new theoretical viewpoints emerge or as novel statistical techniques are developed. Adoption of these practices will lead to increased credibility of meta-analytic conclusions, and facilitate cumulative scientific knowledge.},

Here, we use likelihood ratios to explain when sets of studies that contain a mix of significant and non-significant results are likely to be true, or ‘too true to be bad’. As we show, mixed results are not only likely to be observed in lines of research, but when observed, mixed results often provide evidence for the alternative hypothesis, given reasonable levels of statistical power and an adequately controlled low Type 1 error rate. Researchers should feel comfortable submitting such lines of research with an internal meta-analysis for publication.

As many patients do not beneﬁt from e or have difﬁculties accessing e frontline treatments, novel, effective and easy-to-deliver interventions are needed. Cognitive Bias Modiﬁcation of Interpretations ({CBM}-I) training has been used to treat adult anxiety disorders. {CBM}-I methods train individuals to endorse benign rather than negative resolutions of ambiguous cues. Developmental extensions of {CBM}-I are important for several reasons. First, implementing {CBM}-I in symptomatic children and adolescents may facilitate early preventative gains. Second, as training uses simple learning mechanisms, {CBM}-I may reﬂect a developmentallysuitable strategy for shaping adaptive processing styles. Third, as this age range involves protracted neurocognitive maturation and associated plasticity, administering {CBM}-I early could drive powerful, long-lasting beneﬁts for emotional development. Finally, data from {CBM}-I studies could inform the cognitive mechanisms involved in the genesis of early-emerging anxiety. This paper provides the ﬁrst organised review of {CBM}-I studies conducted in children and adolescents, and contains suggestions for future research that may help realise the therapeutic potential of early {CBM}-I interventions.},

	abstract = {Implicit measures have contributed to important insights in almost every area of psychology. However, various issues and challenges remain concerning their use, one of which is their considerable variation in reliability, with many implicit measures having questionable reliability. The goal of the present investigation was to examine an overlooked consequence of this liability with respect to replication, when such implicit measures are used as dependent variables in experimental studies. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, the authors demonstrate that a higher level of unreliability in such dependent variables is associated with substantially lower levels of replicability. The results imply that this overlooked consequence can have farreaching repercussions for the development of a cumulative science. The authors recommend the routine assessment and reporting of the reliability of implicit measures and also urge the improvement of implicit measures with low reliability.},

This study also set out to validate and investigate the levels of wellbeing and character strengths in the context of a more collective, Mediterranean culture; that of Greece. Three hundred and twelve male and female students from two Greek Universities participated in the study, which consisted of a questionnaire battery, including measures of subjective wellbeing, character strengths and mental and physical health. Youths were found to have a positive outlook on life. Wisdom, courage and transcendence appeared to be the most salient among their character strengths, since character strengths were each highly and positively correlated with the wellbeing subscales of environmental mastery, purpose in life and self-acceptance. Good physical and mental health were positively related to, and reliably predicted different aspects of, both wellbeing and character strengths; nevertheless, mental health appeared to affect and predict more aspects of wellbeing and character strengths than physical health. The significance of the above findings for the field of positive psychology is discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: Cognitive Bias Modiﬁcation ({CBM}) procedures have been used to train individuals to interpret ambiguous information in a negative or benign direction and have provided evidence that negative biases causally contribute to emotional vulnerability.
Method: Here we present the development and validation of a new form of {CBM} designed to manipulate the cognitive errors known to characterize both depression and anxiety. Our manipulation was designed to modify the biased cognitions identiﬁed by Beck’s cognitive error categories (e.g. arbitrary inference, overgeneralisation) and typically targeted during therapy.
Results: In a later test of spontaneous inferences, unselected (Experiment 1) and vulnerable participants (Experiment 2) who had generated positive alternatives rather than errors perceived novel hypothetical events, their causes and outcomes in a non-distorted manner. These groups were also less vulnerable to two different types of emotional stressor (video clips; and an imagined social situation). Furthermore participants’ interpretation of their own performance on a problem-solving task was improved by the manipulation, despite actual performance showing no signiﬁcant change.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings demonstrate that Cognitive Error Modiﬁcation can promote positive inferences, reduce vulnerability to stress and improve self-perceptions of performance. Ó 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1017/S0033291714002013},
	abstract = {Background. Military training is a chronic stressful period that often induces stress-related psychopathology. Stress vulnerability and resilience depend on personality trait anxiety, attentional threat bias and prefrontal–limbic dysfunction. However, how these neurobehavioral elements interact with regard to the development of symptoms following stress remains unclear.
Method. Fifty-ﬁve healthy combat soldiers undergoing intensive military training completed functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) testing while performing the dot-probe task ({DPT}) composed of angry (threat) and neutral faces. Participants were then stratiﬁed according to their bias tendency to avoidance (n = 25) or vigilance (n = 30) groups, categorized as high or low trait anxiety and assessed for post-stress symptom severity.
Results. Avoidance compared to vigilance tendency was associated with fewer post-trauma symptoms and increased hippocampal response to threat among high anxious but not low anxious individuals. Importantly, mediation analysis revealed that only among high anxious individuals did hippocampal activity lead to lower levels of symptoms through avoidance bias tendency. However, in the whole group, avoidance bias was modulated by the interplay between the hippocampus and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ({dACC}).
Conclusions. Our results provide a neurobehavioral model to explain the resilience to post-trauma symptoms following chronic exposure. The model points to the importance of considering threat bias tendency in addition to personality traits when investigating the brain response and symptoms of trauma. Such a multi-parametric approach that accounts for individual behavioral sensitivities may also improve brain-driven treatments of anxiety, possibly by targeting the interplay between the hippocampus and the {dACC}.},

The {DASS} was shown to possess satisfactory psychometric properties, and the factor structure was substantiated both by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. In comparison to the {BDI} and {BAI}, the {DASS} scales showed greater separation in factor loadings. The {DASS} Anxiety scale correlated 0.81 with the {BAI}, and the {DASS} Depression scale correlated 0.74 with the {BDI}. Factor analyses suggested that the {BDI} differs from the {DASS} Depression scale primarily in that the {BDI} includes items such as weight loss, insomnia, somatic preoccupation and irritability, which fail to discriminate between depression and other affective states. The factor structure of the combined {BDI} and {BAI} items was virtually identical to that reported by Beck for a sample of diagnosed depressed and anxious patients, supporting the view that these clinical states are more severe expressions of the same states that may be discerned in normals. Implications of the results for the conceptualisation of depression, anxiety and tension/stress are considered, and the utility of the {DASS} scales in discriminating between these constructs is discussed.},

As empirical research on resilience has burgeoned in recent years, criticisms have been levied at work in this area. These critiques have generally focused on ambiguities in definitions and central terminology; heterogeneity in risks experienced and competence achieved by individuals viewed as resilient; instability of the phenomenon of resilience; and concerns regarding the usefulness of resilience as a theoretical construct. We address each identified criticism in turn, proposing solutions for those we view as legitimate and clarifying misunderstandings surrounding those we believe to be less valid. We conclude that work on resilience possesses substantial potential for augmenting the understanding of processes affecting at-risk individuals. Realization of the potential embodied by this construct, however, will remain constrained without continued scientific attention to some of the serious conceptual and methodological pitfalls that have been noted by skeptics and proponents alike.},

Speciﬁcally, we highlight how maintenance of a clear distinction between process and procedure serves to enhance the advancement of knowledge and understanding, while failure to maintain this distinction can foster confusion and misconception. We show how such clear differentiation has permitted the continuous reﬁnement of assessment procedures, in ways that have led to growing conﬁdence in the existence of the putative attentional bias process of interest, and also increasing understanding of its nature. In contrast, we show how a failure to consistently differentiate between process and procedure has contributed to confusion concerning whether or not attentional bias modiﬁcation reliably alters anxiety vulnerability and dysfunction. As we demonstrate, such confusion can be avoided by distinguishing the process of attentional bias modiﬁcation from the procedures that have been employed with the intention of evoking this target process. Such an approach reveals that procedures adopted with the intention of eliciting the attentional bias modiﬁcation process do not always do so, but that successful evocation of the attentional bias modiﬁcation process quite reliably alters anxiety symptomatology. We consider some of the speciﬁc implications for future research concerning attentional bias modiﬁcation, while also pointing to the broader implications for experimental psychopathology research in general.},

It has been suggested that this processing bias may play a functional role in mediating emotional vulnerability by moderating affective responses to stressful real life events. The current experiment employs a longitudinal design, capable of addressing the central predictions arising from this theoretical position. Thirty-one women awaiting colposcopy investigation were screened on both traditional questionnaire measures of emotional vulnerability, and on a modified emotional Stroop task that provided objective indices of their automatic and strategic patterns of processing selectivity. Subsequently, those 15 women who later received a diagnosis ofcer\&al pathology reported the degr\& to which this diagnosis had impaired their level of emotional functioning. The results confirm that, at the initial test time, Gait anxiety was indeed associated with an apparently automatic tendency to se.l\&tively process threat related distractor information. Furthermore, an index of this initial pattern of automatic processing selectivity was consistently the best predictor of the intensity of emotional distress elicited by the subsequent diagnosis of cervical pathology. None of our conventional questionnaire measures were capable of significantly predicting this later emotional response. We suggest that these findings offer empirical support for the hypotheses that patterns of automatic processing selectivity may moderate individuals’ emotional responses to stressful life events.},

We review research that has sought to evaluate the causal contributions such biases make to anxiety dysfunction and to therapeutically alleviate anxiety using cognitive-bias modiﬁcation ({CBM}) procedures. After considering the purpose and nature of {CBM} methodologies, we show that variants designed to modify selective attention ({CBM}-A) or interpretation ({CBM}-I) have proven capable of reducing anxiety vulnerability and ameliorating dysfunctional anxiety. In addition to supporting the causal role of cognitive bias in anxiety vulnerability and dysfunction and illuminating the mechanisms that underpin such bias, the ﬁndings suggest that {CBM} procedures may have therapeutic promise within clinical settings. We discuss key issues within this burgeoning ﬁeld of research and suggest future directions {CBM} research should take to maximize its theoretical and applied value.},

Exciting potential synergies exist between these two areas of investigation. In this article, we consider ways in which reciprocal benefits could be gained by the constructive transfer of theoretical ideas and methodological approaches between emotion regulation researchers and cognitive-experimental investigators. We also discuss how recent innovations within each field can profitably impact upon progress within the other. It is concluded that the overlap in conceptual constructs, and the convergence of complementary investigative techniques, between these two research domains, provide opportunities for creative synthesis that could significantly enrich understanding of normal and abnormal emotion across future years.},

	abstract = {Objective: The Attention Network Test ({ANT}) is a tool used to assess the efﬁciency of the 3 attention networks—alerting, orienting, and executive control. The {ANT} has become popular in the neuropsychological literature since its ﬁrst description in 2002, with some form of the task currently appearing in no less than 65 original research papers. Although several general reviews of the {ANT} exist, none provide an analysis of its psychometric properties. Method: Data from 15 unique studies were collected, resulting in a large sample (N ϭ 1,129) of healthy individuals. Split-half reliability, variance structure, distribution shape, and independence of measurement of the 3 attention network scores were analyzed, considering both reaction time and accuracy as dependent variables. Results: Split-half reliabilities of reaction time based attention network scores were low for alerting (rweighted ϭ .20, {CI} 95\%weighted [.14, .27], Spearman–Brown r ϭ .38) and orienting (rweighted ϭ .32, {CI} 95\%weighted [.26, .38], Spearman–Brown r ϭ .55), and moderate high for executive control (rweighted ϭ .65, {CI} 95\%weighted [.61, .71], Spearman–Brown r ϭ .81). Analysis of the variance structure of the {ANT} indicated that power to ﬁnd signiﬁcant effects was variable across networks and dependent on the statistical analysis being used. Both analysis of variance (signiﬁcant interaction observed in 100\% of 15 studies) and correlational analyses (multiplesigniﬁcant inter-network correlations observed) suggest that the networks measured by the {ANT} are not independent. Conclusions: In the collection, analysis and interpretation of any test data, psychometric properties, such as those reported here for the {ANT}, must be carefully considered.},

But, there are still many unresolved conceptual and research issues, as more variables are being proposed as relevant. As part of this process, the present paper proposes hardiness as an addition to positive psychology. Hardiness is a combination of attitudes that provides the courage and motivation to do the hard, strategic work of turning stressful circumstances from potential disasters into growth opportunities. In this regard, the inherently stressful nature of living is discussed. Also clarified are the particular aspects of excellence in performance and health to which hardiness is relevant. The paper concludes with a call for issue-resolving research through which orientations and actions proposed as part of positive psychology can be compared in their contributions to performance and health. Two studies along these lines have found hardiness more powerful than optimism and religiousness in coping with stresses.},

Although several measures of {RNT} are available, the items of most of these instruments index {RNT} that is speciﬁc to particular diagnostic groups (e.g., {RNT} about depression symptoms). This has limited our ability to examine the relevance of {RNT} across diagnostic groups and advance our understanding of {RNT} as a transdiagnostic process. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire ({RTQ}), a transdiagnostic measure of {RNT}. In a clinical sample of individuals with anxiety and depressive disorders (N = 186), the {RTQ} demonstrated good internal consistency, convergent, and divergent validity. Supporting the transdiagnostic nature of the measure, the Repetitive Negative Thinking subscale of the {RTQ} was associated with a variety of negative emotions and metacognitive beliefs, and signiﬁcantly predicted symptoms of multiple disorders when controlling for neuroticism. Our ﬁndings support the use of the {RTQ} as a transdiagnostic, trans-emotional measure of maladaptive repetitive thought following distressing events, with scope to increase efﬁciency and reduce burden on patients by assessing {RNT} in clinical settings with one short measure. Experimental and longitudinal research identifying mechanisms driving {RNT} using the {RTQ} would be informative for theory and treatment developments.},

The authors propose that successful reappraisal is related to “affective flexibility”: The ability to flexibly attend to and disengage from emotional aspects of a situation or a stimulus. A new affective task-switching paradigm that required participants to shift between categorizing positive and negative affective pictures according to emotional or nonemotional features was used to assess individual differences in affective flexibility. The results showed that greater affective flexibility (less switch costs) predicted the ability to use reappraisal to down-regulate emotions in response to a sad film clip. In particular, more efficient shifts toward the neutral aspects of negative pictures and toward the emotional aspects of positive pictures were found to predict reappraisal ability. The results imply that executive control of emotional material is a capacity that is closely associated with effective reappraisal.},

We estimated the magnitude of mood-congruent recall for these mood states, examined their robustness, and studied within each mood state the extent to which the strength of mood-congruent recall was related to self-referenced encoding and mood intensity. Asymmetric recall favoring positive stimuli appears to be part of the normative pattern of memory performance among individuals that have been labeled normal nondepressed (ah = .15; p {\textless} ,001); subclinically depressed individuals show symmetric recall of positively and negatively valenced material (Jh = - .02; p {\textgreater} .20).

With the exception of induced elated mood, effect estimates derived from different studies are robust in that sampling error accounts for the entire variability among effect estimates obtainedfrom different studies.

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Repetitive negative thinking ({RNT}) is common to multiple emotional disorders and occurs before, during, and following a stressor. One replicated difference between common forms of {RNT} such as worry and rumination is temporal orientation towards a stressor, with worry being more future-oriented and rumination more past-oriented. Different mechanisms may drive {RNT} at these different time points. The aim of Study 1 was to examine whether previously demonstrated relationships between post-stressor {RNT} and mechanisms theorized to drive engagement in {RNT}, including metacognitive beliefs, cognitive avoidance strategies, and thought control strategies, would be replicated with anticipatory (pre-stressor) {RNT}. The aim of Study 2 was to replicate these associations in a new sample that completed measures of both pre- and post-stressor {RNT}.
Method: Participants in Study 1 (N ¼ 175) completed the {RNT}-L in anticipation of a stressor, along with measures of metacognitive beliefs, cognitive avoidance strategies, and thought control strategies. Participants in Study 2 (N ¼ 91) completed the measures both before and after a stressor. Results: Preand post-stressor {RNT} were signiﬁcantly correlated with all three mechanism measures. Metacognitive beliefs that {RNT} is uncontrollable and dangerous, and the thought control strategy of punishment, were most consistently and uniquely associated with {RNT} at both time-points. Limitations: Replication with clinical samples and with reference to a broader array of stressors is required. The correlational design precluded causal conclusions.
Conclusions: Common and possibly some distinct mechanisms drive {RNT} before and after a stressor. Ó 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Repetitive negative thinking ({RNT}) increases vulnerability to multiple anxiety and depressive disorders and, as a common risk factor, elevated {RNT} may account for the high levels of comorbidity observed between emotional disorders. The aims of this study were to (a) compare two common forms of {RNT} (worry and rumination) across individuals with non-comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders, and (b) to examine the relationship between {RNT} and comorbidity.
Methods: A structured diagnostic interview and measures of rumination, worry, anxiety, and depression were completed by a large clinical sample with an anxiety disorder or depression (N¼ 513) presenting at a community mental health clinic.
Results: Patients without (n ¼ 212) and with (n ¼ 301) comorbid diagnoses did not generally differ across the principal diagnosis groups (depression, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder) on worry or rumination. As predicted, comorbidity was associated with a higher level of {RNT}. Limitations: Cross-sectional design precluded causal conclusions and ﬁndings may not generalize to excluded anxiety disorders.
Conclusions: Consistent with the transdiagnostic hypothesis, {RNT} was associated with a range of anxiety disorders and depression and with comorbidity for those with a principal depressive disorder, supporting recent evidence that {RNT} is a transdiagnostic process. The presence of {RNT}, speciﬁcally worry and rumination, should be assessed and treated regardless of diagnostic proﬁle. Future research may show that both pure and comorbid depressed or anxious patients receive incremental beneﬁt from transdiagnostic protocols developed to treat core pathological processes of {RNT} traditionally associated with separate disorders.},

Probes always replaced the positive face, and subjects pushed a button to indicate the identity of the probe (E or F) as rapidly as possible. In the inverse condition, the probes always replaced the negative face, and in the control condition, the probes replaced each face type equally often. After four training sessions, all groups exhibited statistically indistinguishable, but signiﬁcant, reductions on self-report, behavioral, and physiological measures of speech anxiety. Self-report and behavioral measures of attentional control improved likewise. Contrary to early studies, {ABM} was not superior to control procedures in producing reductions on measures of social anxiety.},

Yet a radically different approach to conceptualizing psychopathology promises to advance our understanding, thereby complementing traditional laboratory experiments. In contrast to viewing symptoms as reﬂective of underlying, latent categories or dimensions, network analysis conceptualizes symptoms as constitutive of mental disorders, not reﬂective of them. Disorders emerge from the causal interactions among symptoms themselves, and intervening on central symptoms in disorder networks promises to foster rapid recovery. One purpose of this article is to contrast network analysis with traditional approaches, and consider its strengths and limitations. A second purpose is to review novel computational methods that may enable researchers to discern the causal structure of disorders (e.g., Bayesian networks). I close by sketching exciting new developments in methods that have direct implications for treatment.},

The measure is based on a control theory perspective of worry and separates the tendency to worry in a way that facilitates goal-pursuit and threat reduction (constructive worry) from the tendency to worry in a way that hinders goal-pursuit while sustaining threat awareness (unconstructive worry). {CUWQ} scores were validated in 2 independent nonclinical samples, including North American (Sample 1, N ϭ 295) and Australian (Sample 2, N ϭ 998) residents. Final factor items were selected based on Sample 1, and the measure showed good model fit through a confirmatory factor analysis in Sample 2. In addition, scores on the 2 worry factors showed criterion-related validity by statistically predicting a variety of outcomes in both samples: Constructive worry was positively associated with punctuality and wildfire preparedness and negatively associated with trait-anxiety and amount of worry. Unconstructive worry, on the other hand, was positively associated with trait-anxiety and amount of worry, and negatively associated with punctuality and wildfire preparedness. The 2 factor scores were uncorrelated in Sample 1 and positively correlated in Sample 2, thereby showing that having a tendency to worry in an unconstructive manner does not prohibit 1 from worrying in a constructive manner as well. Understanding how the 2 tendencies to worry differ from each other and separating their measurement enables a better understanding of the role of worry in both normal behavior and psychopathology.},

	abstract = {The current meta-analysis explores the strength of effects of cognitive bias modification training for interpretation bias ({CBM}-I) on positive (i.e., adaptive) interpretations and mood as well as the training and sample characteristics influencing these effects. Data-bases were searched with the key words ‘‘interpret* bias {AND} training’’ and ‘‘interpret* bias {AND} modif*’’. Reference lists of identified articles were checked and authors of identified articles were contacted for further relevant articles and unpublished data. Studies were reviewed for inclusion with eligibility criteria being that the study (a) aimed to target interpretation biases through any kind of training, (b) assessed mood and/or interpretation bias as outcome measures, (c) allocated individuals to training conditions at random, and (d) recruited adult samples. A meta-analytic multilevel mixed-effects model was employed to assess standardized mean changes in interpretation bias, negative mood, and emotional reactivity. In addition, several training and sample characteristics were explored for their potential to enhance benign training effectiveness. On average, benign {CBM}-I resulted in an increase in positive interpretation bias (p, .01) and a decrease in negative mood state (p,.001), but did not affect emotional reactivity. These effects were not consistently different from control conditions with no or neutral training. However, within benign training conditions imagery instructions and more training sessions were related to larger cognitive and mood effects, whereas feedback about training performance and inclusion of non-benign training items (instead of including benign items only) boosted cognitive effects only. Finally, training was more effective in women (cognitive and mood effects) and presumably samples with symptomatic emotional dysregulation (cognitive effects). Although the effects of emotional dysregulation and number of training sessions could not well be distinguished, there is an indication that when used with imagery instructions and more training sessions, benign {CBM}-I can be employed as a useful complementary treatment to usual psychotherapies.},

Results showed that negative interpretations of social situations were more common in the high anxious than control group. Such negative bias could not be accounted for by high levels of negative affect. The groups did not differ as to their positive interpretations. Furthermore, there was evidence for content speciﬁcity of interpretation bias; high anxious adolescents were not more negative than control participants in their interpretations of non-social situations.

Study 1 (N = 326) examined the role of trait {AP}, worry, and rumination in predicting symptoms of social anxiety, depression, and trait anxiety and found that all three {RNT} styles predicted social anxiety, but only worry predicted trait anxiety and only rumination predicted depressive symptoms. Study 2 (N = 353) used a prospective design to examine how cognitions and symptoms reciprocally interact and found that only worry predicted future social anxiety, but social anxiety predicted later {AP} and rumination. Results suggest worry may serve as a risk factor for social anxiety, whereas {AP} and rumination may serve as maintenance factors. Furthermore, worry and rumination may be transdiagnostic, whereas {AP} may be speciﬁc to social anxiety.},

Drawing participants from higher-income and lower-income backgrounds, we tested how adults who grew up in harsh or unpredictable environments fared on 2 types of executive function tasks: inhibition and shifting. People who experienced unpredictable childhoods performed worse at inhibition (overriding dominant responses), but performed better at shifting (efficiently switching between different tasks). This finding is consistent with the notion that shifting, but not inhibition, is especially useful in unpredictable environments. Importantly, differences in executive function between people who experienced unpredictable versus predictable childhoods emerged only when they were tested in uncertain contexts. This catalyst suggests that some individual differences related to early life experience are manifested under conditions of uncertainty in adulthood. Viewed as a whole, these findings indicate that adverse childhood environments do not universally impair mental functioning, but can actually enhance specific types of cognitive performance in the face of uncertainty.},

Participants performed color or shape judgments according to explicit word cues ({COLOR} or {SHAPE}) or less transparent letter cues (C for the color task and S for the shape task). In the word cue condition, the switch cost was equivalent for the articulatory suppression and the control (no dual-task) conditions, but, in the letter cue condition, the switch cost was significantly greater for the articulatory suppression condition than for the control condition.

	abstract = {Past research has shown that possessing a strong sense of community or esteem for one’s community is positively related to feelings of psychological wellbeing. Much less research has examined what mechanisms may underlie this relationship. Self-determination theory, a theory of human personality and optimal functioning, proposes the existence of three speciestypical basic psychological needs (for competence, relatedness, and autonomy), the satisfaction of which is crucial for experiencing wellbeing. We hypothesized that need satisfaction is a mediator of the relationship between feelings of esteem for one’s community and several widely employed measures of wellbeing among a sample of residents living in an urban community in the United States. In accord with the primary hypotheses, the results revealed a robust association between community esteem and both hedonic and eudaimonic measures of wellbeing. Furthermore, the associations between community esteem and wellbeing were mediated by self-reported satisfaction of basic psychological needs. This work contributes to an improved understanding of the complex relationship between esteem for one’s community and psychological wellbeing and has implications for debates surrounding the benefits and role of community in individuals’ lives.},

	abstract = {An ever-growing number of transdiagnostic processes that maintain psychopathology across disorders have been identified. However, such processes are not consistently associated with psychological distress and symptoms. An understanding of what makes such processes pathological is required. One possibility is that individual differences in rigidity in the implementation of these processes determine the degree of psychopathology. The aim of this article is to examine the relationship between rigidity/flexibility and transdiagnostic maintenance processes. Initial searches were made for research examining relationships between 18 transdiagnostic processes and rigidity/flexibility. Relationships between rumination, perfectionism, impulsivity and compulsivity, and rigidity/flexibility were systemically reviewed; 50 studies met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies indicated that transdiagnostic cognitive and behavioral maintenance processes and rigidity were correlated, co-occurring, or predictive of each other. Findings are consistent with the hypothesis that it is inflexibility in the manner in which processes are employed that makes them pathologically problematic. However, further research is required to test and establish this.},

Using the computer based Balloon Analogue Risk Task, we assessed risk taking behaviour in behaviourally inhibited (n = 27) and behaviourally disinhibited (n = 43) children. This is the ﬁrst study to examine the relationship between {BI}, executive functioning and risk-taking.

Computerized cognitive training ({CCT}) paradigms offer potential to improve cognition, mood and everyday functioning, but their effectiveness is not well established. The goal of this article was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the efﬁcacy of {CCT} in depressive disorders.
Method: A search was conducted to identify high quality randomized controlled {CCT} trials per {PRISMA} guidelines using {PsycINFO} and {MEDLINE} with the keywords “Cognitive training” or “Cognitive remediation” or “Cognitive rehabilitation” and “Depression”. 9 randomized trials for depressed adults met inclusion criteria. Effect sizes (Hedge's g) were calculated for key outcome measures of mood symptom severity, daily functioning, and cognition. A 3-level Bayesian hierarchical linear model was used to estimate effect sizes for each domain and study. Publication bias was assessed using Classic Fail Safe N's and homogeneity was evaluated using Q and I2 indexes.
Results: Signiﬁcant small-moderate effects for Symptom Severity (0.43) and Daily Functioning (0.72), and moderate-large effects for Attention (0.67), Working Memory (0.72), and Global Functioning (1.05) were found. No signiﬁcant effects were found for Executive Functioning or Verbal Memory. Moderator variable analysis revealed decreased effect of {CCT} with age. Gender and concurrent medication treatment did not affect the results. Limitations: Small sample size, short duration, pseudo-speciﬁcity, and high heterogeneity for Verbal Memory measures.
Conclusions: {CCT} is associated with improvement in depressive symptoms and everyday functioning, though produces inconsistent effects on cognition.},

	url = {http://www.nature.com/articles/ijo2008218},
	doi = {10.1038/ijo.2008.218},
	abstract = {Objective: Cortisol is elevated in individuals with both increased emotional stress and higher percentages of body fat. Cortisol is also known to affect cognitive performance, particularly spatial processing and working memory. We hypothesized that increased body fat might therefore be associated with decreased performance on a spatial processing task, in response to an acute real-world stressor. Design: We tested two separate samples of participants undergoing their first (tandem) skydive. In the first sample (N ¼ 78), participants were tested for salivary cortisol and state anxiety (Spielberger State Anxiety Scale) during the plane’s 15-min ascent to altitude in immediate anticipation of the jump. In a second sample (N ¼ 20), participants were tested for salivary cortisol, as well as cardiac variables (heart rate, autonomic regulation through heart rate variability) and performance on a cognitive task of spatial processing, selective attention and working memory.
Results: In response to the skydive, individuals with greater body fat percentages showed significantly increased reactivity for both cortisol (on both samples) and cognition, including decreased accuracy of our task of spatial processing, selective attention and working memory. These cognitive effects were restricted to the stress response and were not found under baseline conditions. There were no body fat interactions with cardiac changes in response to the stressor, suggesting that the cognitive effects were specifically hormone mediated rather than secondary to general activation of the autonomic nervous system.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that, under real-world stress, increased body fat may be associated with endocrine stress vulnerability, with consequences for deleterious cognitive performance.

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Attentional bias modiﬁcation ({ABM}) is a potentially exciting new development in the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, reported therapeutic beneﬁts have not always been replicated. To gauge the sensitivity of tasks used in {ABM} treatment and assessment, we used a counterbalanced within-subject design to measure their discriminant sensitivity to neutral and threatening facial expressions, comparing them with other well-known tasks that measure visual attention.
Methods: We compared two tasks often used in the assessment and treatment of attention bias (the dotprobe and the spatial cueing paradigms) with two well-known visual attention tasks (the irrelevant singleton and attentional blink paradigms), measuring their sensitivity to processing differences between threatening and neutral expressions for non-clinical observers.
Results: The dot-probe, spatial cueing and irrelevant singleton paradigms showed little or no sensitivity to processing differences between facial expressions while the attentional blink task proved very sensitive to such differences. Furthermore, the attentional blink task provided an intriguing picture of the temporal dynamics of attentional biases that the other paradigms cannot do. Limitations: These results need to be replicated with larger samples, including a comparison of a group of individuals diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and normal controls.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that the sensitivity of putative attentional bias measures should be assessed experimentally for more powerful assessment and treatment of such biases. If the attentional blink task is indeed particularly sensitive to attentional biases, as our ﬁndings indicate, it is not unreasonable to expect that interventions based on this task may be more effective than those based on the tasks that are currently used.},

Cronbach’s alpha is often viewed as some kind of quality label: high values certify scale quality, low values prompt removal of one or several items. Unfortunately, this approach suffers two fundamental problems. First, Cronbach’s alpha is both unrelated to a scale's internal consistency and a fatally flawed estimate of its reliability. Second, the approach itself assumes that scale items are repeated measurements, an assumption that is often violated and rarely desirable. The problems with Cronbach’s alpha are easily solved by computing readily available alternatives, such as the Greatest Lower Bound or Omega. Solving the second problem, however, is less straightforward. This requires forgoing the appealing comfort of a quantitative, seemingly objective indicator of scale quality altogether, instead acknowledging the dynamics of reliability and validity and the distinction between scales and indices. In this contribution, I will explore these issues, and provide recommendations for scale inspection that takes these dynamics and this distinction into account.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives: Abnormal threat-related attention in anxiety disorders is most commonly assessed and modified using the dot-probe paradigm; however, poor psychometric properties of reaction-time measures may contribute to inconsistencies across studies. Typically, standard attention measures are derived using average reaction-times obtained in experimentallydefined conditions. However, current approaches based on experimentally-defined conditions are limited. In this study, the psychometric properties of a novel response-based computation approach to analyze dot-probe data are compared to standard measures of attention.
Methods: 148 adults (19.19 ± 1.42, 84 women) completed a standardized dot-probe task including threatening and neutral faces. We generated both standard and response-based measures of attention bias, attentional orientation, and attentional disengagement. We compared overall internal consistency, number of trials necessary to reach internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and criterion validity obtained using each approach.
Results: Compared to standard attention measures, response-based measures demonstrated uniformly high levels of internal consistency with relatively few trials and varying improvements in test-retest reliability. Additionally, response-based measures demonstrated specific evidence of anxiety-related associations above and beyond both standard attention measures and other confounds. Limitations: Future studies are necessary to validate this approach in clinical samples.
Conclusions: Response-based attention measures demonstrate superior psychometric properties compared to standard attention measures, which may improve the detection of anxiety-related associations and treatment-related changes in clinical samples.},

It remains unclear whether those with {GAD} experience more dysregulated emotions during periods of euthymia and positive affect or whether these deﬁcits occur only during periods of worry. Individuals with {GAD} (with and without co-occurring dysphoria) and non-anxious controls were randomly assigned to receive a worry, neutral, or relaxation induction. Following the induction, all participants viewed a ﬁlm clip documented to elicit sadness. Intensity of emotions and emotion regulation were examined following the induction period and ﬁlm clip. The results revealed that, regardless of co-occurring dysphoria, individuals with {GAD} in the worry condition experienced more intense depressed affect than {GAD} participants in the other conditions and controls participants. In contrast, presence of worry appeared to have less impact on indices of emotion dysregulation, which were greater in participants with {GAD} compared to controls, but largely insensitive to contextual effects of worry or of relaxation. Following ﬁlm viewing, both {GAD} participants with and without dysphoria displayed poorer understanding, acceptance, and management of emotions than did controls. However, acceptance and management deﬁcits were most pronounced in individuals with both {GAD} and co-occurring dysphoria.

Several dissociations between {LRP} and mu-{MRAA} and beta-{MRAA} were found. Mu-{MRAA} and beta-{MRAA}, but not {LRP}, exhibited an early and strong reversal in cortical lateralization when advance preparation for a switch of response hand was required. {LRP}, but not mu-{MRAA} or beta-{MRAA}, was sensitive to manipulation of the probability that advance preparation of response hand would be useful in a response precuing task. These dissociations replicate earlier findings and suggest that movement-related cortical rhythms and cortical potentials are associated with distinct preparatory component processes that differ in terms of level of abstraction and effort, in line with similar functional distinctions between component processes underlying executive control in task switching. This suggests that a fine-grained analysis of subprocesses involved in motor control may provide important guiding principles for the study and understanding of levels and mechanisms of cognitive control.},

	abstract = {Prominent cognitive theories postulate that an attentional bias toward threatening information contributes to the etiology, maintenance, or exacerbation of fear and anxiety. In this review, we investigate to what extent these causal claims are supported by sound empirical evidence. Although differences in attentional bias are associated with differences in fear and anxiety, this association does not emerge consistently. Moreover, there is only limited evidence that individual differences in attentional bias are related to individual differences in fear or anxiety. In line with a causal relation, some studies show that attentional bias precedes fear or anxiety in time. However, other studies show that fear and anxiety can precede the onset of attentional bias, suggesting circular or reciprocal causality. Importantly, a recent line of experimental research shows that changes in attentional bias can lead to changes in anxiety. Yet changes in fear and anxiety also lead to changes in attentional bias, which confirms that the relation between attentional bias and fear and anxiety is unlikely to be unidirectional. Finally, a similar causal relation between interpretation bias and anxiety has been documented. In sum, there is evidence in favor of causality, yet a strict unidirectional cause– effect model is unlikely to hold. The relation between attentional bias and fear and anxiety is best described as a bidirectional, maintaining, or mutually reinforcing relation.},

Their findings were obtained from subjects who were currently stressed.

Using a sample of 32 volunteers, we found a significant correlation between trait anxiety and threat-relevant interference on a masked Stroop. Furthermore, it was found that the single best predictor of vulnerability to life stress was the interference on the masked Stroop. The findings of the present study correspond quite closely to those reported by Macleod and Hagan (1992).},

A parameter recovery study shows that — with plausible restrictions on the number of participants and trials — both parameters (i.e., risk taking γ + and response consistency β) can be estimated accurately. To demonstrate how the 2-parameter model can be used in practice, we implemented a Bayesian hierarchical version and applied it to an empirical data set in which participants performed the {BART} following various amounts of alcohol intake.},

The goal of this study is to investigate whether adaptive and/or maladaptive emotion regulation strategies moderate the relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms under stress.
Methods: In a longitudinal study, 92 healthy but unselected undergraduates were followed for three months including a stress period (four weeks of examinations).
Results: Our ﬁndings demonstrate that the more adaptive emotion regulation strategies are used in daily life (measured at baseline), the weaker the relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms during stress. Interestingly, no single strategy demonstrates a unique predictive value, but only the combination of several adaptive strategies moderates the relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms. Although participants with elevated depressive symptoms use more maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, these latter strategies do not moderate the association between dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms. Limitations: The use of a sample of undergraduates limits the generalizability and the clinical signiﬁcance of our results.
Conclusions: Altogether, although dysfunctional attitudes are activated and accessible in response to certain life stressors, the strategies that healthy individuals use to adaptively regulate these cognitions seem important in determining the likelihood of depressive symptoms.},

	abstract = {Emotions can occur during an emotion-eliciting event, but they can also arise when anticipating the event. We used pupillary responses, as a measure of effortful cognitive processing, to test whether the anticipation of an emotional stimulus (positive and negative) inﬂuences the subsequent online processing of that emotional stimulus. Moreover, we tested whether individual differences in the habitual use of emotion regulation strategies are associated with pupillary responses during the anticipation and/or online processing of this emotional stimulus. Our results show that, both for positive and negative stimuli, pupillary diameter during the anticipation of emotion-eliciting events is inversely and strongly correlated to pupillary responses during the emotional image presentation. The variance in this temporal interplay between anticipation and online processing was related to individual differences in emotion regulation. Speciﬁcally, the results show that high reappraisal scores are related to larger pupil diameter during the anticipation which is related to smaller pupillary responses during the online processing of emotion-eliciting events. The habitual use of expressive suppression was not associated to pupillary responses in the anticipation and subsequent online processing of emotional stimuli. Taken together, the current data suggest (most strongly for individuals scoring high on the habitual use of reappraisal) that larger pupillary responses during the anticipation of an emotional stimulus are indicative of a sustained attentional set activation to prepare for an upcoming emotional stimulus, which subsequently directs a reduced need to cognitively process that emotional event. Hence, because the habitual use of reappraisal is known to have a positive inﬂuence on emotional well-being, the interplay between anticipation and online processing of emotional stimuli might be a signiﬁcant marker of this well-being.},

Fifty-nine healthy adult volunteers received rigged social feedback (criticism and praise) based on their photograph. Gaze data were collected to investigate processes of attentional deployment/allocation toward the self or the evaluator expressing criticism or praise. Whereas voluntary attention was directed to evaluators who expressed praise, attention was drawn to one’s own picture after criticism. Pupil dilation and heart-rate variability were larger in response to criticism as compared to praise, suggesting a flexible and adaptive emotion regulatory effort in response to social information that triggers an affective response. Altogether, healthy individuals recruited more regulatory resources to cope with negative (as compared to positive) social feedback, and this processing of social feedback was associated with adjustments in self-focused attention.},

	abstract = {The credibility revolution (sometimes referred to as the “replicability crisis”) in psychology has brought about many changes in the standards by which psychological science is evaluated. These changes include (a) greater emphasis on transparency and openness, (b) a move toward preregistration of research, (c) more direct-replication studies, and (d) higher standards for the quality and quantity of evidence needed to make strong scientific claims. What are the implications of these changes for productivity, creativity, and progress in psychological science? These questions can and should be studied empirically, and I present my predictions here. The productivity of individual researchers is likely to decline, although some changes (e.g., greater collaboration, data sharing) may mitigate this effect. The effects of these changes on creativity are likely to be mixed: Researchers will be less likely to pursue risky questions; more likely to use a broad range of methods, designs, and populations; and less free to define their own best practices and standards of evidence. Finally, the rate of scientific progress—the most important shared goal of scientists—is likely to increase as a result of these changes, although one’s subjective experience of making progress will likely become rarer.},

Over the last few years, academic debate has, from a scientific perspective, gone back to two ancient philosophical orientations, namely hedonism and eudaimonia. The hedonic approach conceives well-being as the presence of positive affect and lack of negative affect, whilst the eudaimonic perspective regards well-being as the consequence of a full psychological actualization from which people develop their whole potential. Whether assessed from a hedonic or eudaimonic perspective, well-being seems to play a role in the prevention of and in the recovery of physical conditions and diseases and so possibly contributes to an increase in life expectancy. Finally, the implications of these findings are discussed both from an academic perspective and, more generally speaking, from a social and political point of view.},

Three types of childhood events were assessed in 83 neverdepressed and 337 formerly depressed individuals: trauma within the family, trauma outside the family, and adverse events. Furthermore, after a sad mood induction procedure, participants executed a Dot Probe task (selective attentional bias), an Emotional Stroop task (attentional interference bias) and an incidental learning task (memory bias). The association of these measures with case status and recurrence status (one or multiple past episodes) was examined. Negative memory bias and traumatic childhood events within the family were associated with case status, whereas none of the bias measures or childhood events variables were associated with recurrence status. The results indicate that memory bias as well as the experience of aggression and/or abuse within the family during childhood are independently associated with depression.

We show that these correlations are higher than should be expected given the (evidently limited) reliability of both {fMRI} and personality measures. The high correlations are all the more puzzling because method sections rarely contain much detail about how the correlations were obtained. We surveyed authors of 55 articles that reported ﬁndings of this kind to determine a few details on how these correlations were computed. More than half acknowledged using a strategy that computes separate correlations for individual voxels and reports means of only those voxels exceeding chosen thresholds. We show how this nonindependent analysis inﬂates correlations while yielding reassuring-looking scattergrams. This analysis technique was used to obtain the vast majority of the implausibly high correlations in our survey sample. In addition, we argue that, in some cases, other analysis problems likely created entirely spurious correlations. We outline how the data from these studies could be reanalyzed with unbiased methods to provide accurate estimates of the correlations in question and urge authors to perform such reanalyses. The underlying problems described here appear to be common in {fMRI} research of many kinds—not just in studies of emotion, personality, and social cognition.},

	abstract = {The aim of this multi-informant twin study was to determine the relative role of genetic and environmental factors in explaining variation in trait resilience in adolescents. Participants were consenting families (N = 2,638 twins in 1,394 families), from seven national cohorts (age 12–18 years, both sexes) of monozygotic and dizygotic twins reared together. Questionnaire data on the adolescents’ Ego-resilience ({ER}89) was collected from mothers, fathers and twins, and analysed by means of multivariate genetic modelling. Variance in trait resilience was best represented in an {ADE} common pathways model with sex limitation. Variance in the latent psychometric resilience factor was largely explained by additive genetic factors (77\% in boys, 70\% in girls), with the remaining variance (23 and 30\%) attributable to non-shared environmental factors. Additive genetic sources explained more than 50\% of the informant speciﬁc variation in mothers and fathers scores. In twins, additive and non-additive genetic factors together explained 40\% and non-shared environmental factor the remaining 60\% of variation. In the mothers’ scores, the additive genetic effect was larger for boys than for girls. The non-additive genetic factor found in the twins’ self ratings was larger in boys than in girls. The remaining sex differences in the speciﬁc factors were small. Trait resilience is largely genetically determined.},

The current study experimentally trained differential biases in participants’ (N ϭ 55) attention toward positive or neutral information. In each training trial, one positive and one neutral word were presented and then a visual target appeared consistently in the location of the positive or neutral words. Participants were instructed to make a simple perceptual discrimination response to the target. Immediately before and after attentional training, participants were exposed to a stress task consisting of viewing a series of extremely negative images while having their eyes tracked. Visual fixation time to negative images, assessed with an eye tracker, served as an indicator of using gaze to successfully regulate emotion. Those participants experimentally trained to selectively attend to affectively positive information looked significantly less at the negative images in the visual stress task following the attentional training, thus demonstrating a learned aversion to negative stimuli. Participants trained toward neutral information did not show this biased gaze pattern.},

The current study assessed the reliability and convergent validity of dot probe and emotional cueing bias scores in high-anxious and low-anxious participants in the context of a state anxiety manipulation to increase the likelihood of producing large, potentially reliable attentional biases. One hundred sixty participants completed an anxious or calm mood induction followed by dot probe and emotional cueing tasks. Reliability estimates for bias scores in the full sample were low, ranging from 0 to .44; convergent validity estimates were also poor. The anxiety induction did not substantially improve the reliability or validity of the measures. These results underscore the importance of developing new, more reliable attentional bias measures for future research.},

Results indicated that dot probe bias scores, eye movement ﬁrst ﬁxation indices, and eye movement proportions of viewing time in the ﬁrst 1,500 ms had unacceptably low reliability. However, eye movement indices of attentional bias over the full 5,000 ms time course had excellent reliability.

Researchers themselves may not be immune to these fallacies and may unwittingly adjust their statistical analysis to produce an outcome that is more pleasant or better in line with prior expectations. To shield researchers from the impact of cognitive fallacies, several methodologists are now advocating preregistration—that is, the creation of a detailed analysis plan before data collection or data analysis. One may argue, however, that preregistration is out of touch with academic reality, hampering creativity and impeding scientific progress. We provide a historical overview to show that the interplay between creativity and verification has shaped theories of scientific inquiry throughout the centuries; in the currently dominant theory, creativity and verification operate in succession and enhance one another’s effectiveness. From this perspective, the use of preregistration to safeguard the verification stage will help rather than hinder the generation of fruitful new ideas.},

Thus far, nearly all research has been based on the {ANEW} norms collected by Bradley and Lang (1999) for 1,034 words. We extend the database to nearly 14 thousand English lemmas, providing researchers with a much richer source of information, including information on gender, age and educational differences in emotion norms. As an example of the new possibilities, we included the stimuli from nearly all category norms (types of diseases, occupations, and taboo words) collected by Van Overschelde, Rawson,and Dunlosky (2004), making it possible to include affect in studies on semantic memory.},

	abstract = {Background. Structural models of emotional disorders propose that anxiety disorders can be classiﬁed into fear and distress disorders. Sources of evidence for this distinction come from genetic, self-report and neurophysiological data from adults. The present study examined whether this distinction relates to cognitive processes, indexed by attention bias towards threat, which is thought to cause and maintain anxiety disorders.
Method. Diagnostic and attention bias data were analysed from 435 children between 5 and 13 years of age; 158 had principal fear disorder (speciﬁc phobia, social phobia or separation anxiety disorder), 75 had principal distress disorder (generalized anxiety disorder, {GAD}) and 202 had no psychiatric disorder. Anxious children were a clinic-based treatment-seeking sample. Attention bias was assessed on a visual-probe task with angry, neutral and happy faces.
Results. Compared to healthy controls, children with principal distress disorder ({GAD}) showed a signiﬁcant bias towards threat relative to neutral faces whereas children with principal fear disorder showed an attention bias away from threat relative to neutral faces. Overall, children displayed an attention bias towards happy faces, irrespective of diagnostic group.
Conclusions. Our ﬁndings support the distinction between fear and distress disorders, and extend empirically derived structural models of emotional disorders to threat processing in childhood, when many anxiety disorders begin and predict lifetime impairment.},

	abstract = {Field studies and laboratory experiments have documented that a key component of resilience is emotional flexibility—the ability to respond flexibly to changing emotional circumstances. In the present study we tested the hypotheses that resilient people exhibit emotional flexibility: (a) in response to frequently changing emotional stimuli and (b) across multiple modalities of emotional responding. As participants viewed a series of emotional pictures, we assessed their self-reported affect, facial muscle activity, and startle reflexes. Higher trait resilience predicted more divergent affective and facial responses (corrugator and zygomatic) to positive versus negative pictures. Thus, compared with their low-resilient counterparts, resilient people appear to be able to more flexibly match their emotional responses to the frequently changing emotional stimuli. Moreover, whereas high-trait-resilient participants exhibited divergent startle responses to positive versus negative pictures regardless of the valence of the preceding trial, low-trait-resilient participants did not exhibit divergent startle responses when the preceding picture was negative. High-trait-resilient individuals, therefore, appear to be better able than are their low-resilient counterparts to either switch or maintain their emotional responses depending on whether the emotional context changes. The present findings broaden our understanding of the mechanisms underlying resilience by demonstrating that resilient people are able to flexibly change their affective and physiological responses to match the demands of frequently changing environmental circumstances.},

Using an anonymous elicitation format supplemented by incentives for honest reporting, we surveyed over 2,000 psychologists about their involvement in questionable research practices. The impact of truth-telling incentives on self-admissions of questionable research practices was positive, and this impact was greater for practices that respondents judged to be less defensible. Combining three different estimation methods, we found that the percentage of respondents who have engaged in questionable practices was surprisingly high. This finding suggests that some questionable practices may constitute the prevailing research norm.},

We used a representative sample of 973 twin pairs to test the hypothesis that heritable differences in subjective well-being are entirely accounted for by the genetic architecture of the Five-Factor Model’s personality domains. Results supported this model. Subjective well-being was accounted for by unique genetic inﬂuences from Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness, and by a common genetic factor that inﬂuenced all ﬁve personality domains in the directions of low Neuroticism and high Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. These ﬁndings indicate that subjective well-being is linked to personality by common genes and that personality may form an ‘‘affective reserve’’ relevant to set-point maintenance and changes in set point over time.},

This deterioration in mood raises an important methodological issue and indicates that the increased testing time brought about by auditory compared to visual presentation needs to be addressed. The {CBM} procedures did not inﬂuence emotional vulnerability as assessed by behavioural measures, but counter-to-prediction, {CBM} procedures did increase self-reported depression vulnerability for the positive but not negative {CBM} condition.},

In a novel {CBM} procedure participants read either positive or negative statements relating to social issues for 5 min. Interpretation bias was measured by means of a scrambled sentence test, which was presented both before and after the {CBM} procedure. Participants who read the positive statements made more positive resolutions to the scrambled sentences, while participants who read the negative statements made more negative resolutions. Thus, the appropriate positive and negative interpretative biases were induced by the {CBM} procedure. However, signiﬁcant mood changes also occurred following {CBM}. In Experiment 2, a musical mood induction procedure was presented with depressing or elating music. As before, a scrambled sentence test was presented both before and after the musical mood induction. Mood changed in accordance with the valence of the music to the same extent as with {CBM}. Critically however, performance on the scrambled sentence task did not change for both groups. This demonstrates that a change in mood state is not sufﬁcient for a change in cognitive bias to occur.},

Recent developments of the task have favoured the use of human faces as stimuli, however, results from this task have been inconsistent. In 2005, Schmukle published very poor reliability estimates for two versions of the dot-probe task using words and situational images as stimuli. The present study tested the reliability of two versions of the test, using photographs of human faces. One version was similar to previous research, while the other was a modification designed to meet a potential methodological issue. Results indicate that both versions tested were unreliable and therefore unsuitable for individual differences research. When considered as a group, however, participants showed consistent attentional bias towards emotional faces in the task similar to previous research, while habituation effects were found in the modified task. This suggests that the two tasks may be used in between-group designs to investigate different aspects of attention to emotional faces.},

Individuals diagnosed with {GAD} and healthy participants ({HPs}) performed a random key-pressing task while thinking about a worrisome or a positive future event, to assess the extent to which attentional control resources are used by worry. Attentional control was also assessed when participants were not instructed to think about a specific topic using the N-back task, which varies in task difficulty, and therefore is sensitive to subtle differences in ability to handle increasing demands on attentional control within the same paradigm. {GAD} participants (but not {HPs}) were less random while worrying than thinking about a positive event during the key-pressing task, suggesting that worry consumed more attentional control resources in this population. During the N-Back task, {GAD} participants performed worse than {HPs} during the high load conditions only, indicating greater difficulty in sustaining focus on conditions requiring a higher degree of attentional control, even without concurrent task activity. Poor attentional control might underpin the difficulty of {GAD} individuals to stop worrying and switch to thinking more benign information. Further research could investigate whether worry consumes attentional control resources in other psychological disorders with high rates of worry (e.g., panic disorder, psychosis), as well as the extent to which attentional control is used by other forms of repetitive thinking, such as depressive rumination.},

Cumulative risk and promotive factor indices represented individual characteristics, and peer, parental, and familial influences. Using growth curve modeling, we describe trajectories of cumulative risk and promotive factors and test the associations between the time-varying cumulative risk and promotive factor indices and violent behavior. Higher risk was associated with higher levels of violent behavior. Higher levels of promotive factors were associated with less violent behavior and moderated the association between risk and violent behaviors. The results support the risk-protective model of resiliency. Implications for prevention are discussed.},

	abstract = {The current study examines the relationship between attention bias for positive emotional words and self-reported emotional experience. Previous research suggests that the experience of positive emotion momentarily broadens cognitive processes, potentially allowing individuals to build an array of enduring personal resources. However, it is unknown whether the experience of positive emotion also broadens emotional information processing. Participants included 60 healthy undergraduate students who completed measures of psychopathology, self-reported emotional experience, and an emotional Stroop task designed to measure attentional bias to positive and negative emotional information. Results indicate significant associations between reaction times for high-intensity happiness words and self-reported high levels of positive emotion and low levels of negative emotions. These associations were not present for low intensity happiness words. Findings suggest that individuals who experience high levels of positive emotion and low levels of negative emotion demonstrate an attention bias for positive information and, from an information processing perspective, provide insight into the manner in which positive emotions broaden cognitive processes.},

However, little is known about the role of positive emotional processing in modulating anxiety reactivity to stress. In the current study, we used an attentional training paradigm designed to experimentally manipulate the processing of positive emotional cues. Participants were randomly assigned to complete a computerized probe detection task designed to induce selective processing of positive stimuli or to a sham condition. Following training, participants were exposed to a laboratory stressor (i.e., videotaped speech), and state anxiety and positive affect in response to the stressor were assessed. Results revealed that individual variability in the capacity to develop an attentional bias for positive information following training predicted subsequent emotional responses to the stressor. Moreover, individual differences in social anxiety, but not depression, moderated the effects of the attentional manipulation, such that, higher levels of social anxiety were associated with diminished attentional allocation toward positive cues. The current findings point to the potential value of considering the role of positive emotional processing in anxiety vulnerability.},

This study examined whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ({rTMS}) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({DLPFC}) promotes resilience in an aversive stimulus model of {LH}. All 55 participants were told that an undisclosed sequence of button presses would terminate an aversive stimulus on their forearm. In truth, only half had control (þ C). The other half had no control ( À C). All participants received real (R) or sham (S) left {DLPFC} {rTMS} during the paradigm ( þC/R, À C/S,þ C/S, À C/R). We evaluated the cognitive effects of {LH} using an anagram task. The {LH} paradigm successfully reduced perceived control in the À C groups. As predicted, the þC/R and þ C/S groups tended to give up less quickly and take less time to solve each anagram than did the À C/S group. Superior anagram performance in the À C/R group approached statistical signiﬁcance. Our preliminary results suggest that manipulating the controllability of an aversive stimulus may induce an {LH} effect that manifests as impaired anagram performance. Further research is needed to reﬁne this model and determine if {DLPFC} {rTMS} mitigates any {LH} effects.},

Participants who had experienced distant adversity (N = 53), no adversity (N = 58), or recent adversity only (N = 20) performed an emotion nback task with emotional facial expressions. Results revealed that the distant adversity group exhibited signiﬁcantly faster reaction times ({RTs}) than the no adversity and recent adversity only groups. In contrast, the recent adversity only group exhibited signiﬁcantly slower {RTs} and more errors than the distant adversity and no adversity groups.

Within this article, we (1) systematically review prospective and experimental research exploring {ABs} and pain outcomes in light of current theoretical models and (2) propose a theoretical framework for understanding {AB} in pain. Across prospective research, an attentional pattern of vigilance–avoidance was observed. Interventions targeting {ABs} were less consistent; however, there were promising findings among studies that found attentional training effects, particularly for laboratory research. The proposed Threat Interpretation Model suggests a relationship between threat, interpretation, and stimuli in determining attentional processes, which while tentative generates important testable predictions regarding the role of attention in pain and builds on previous theoretical and empirical work in this area.},

	abstract = {Background: This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efﬁcacy of a preventive intervention for anxiety disorders and depression by targeting excessive levels of repetitive negative thinking ({RNT}; worry and rumination) in adolescents and young adults.
Methods: Participants (N ¼ 251, 83.7\% female) showing elevated levels of {RNT} were randomly allocated to a 6-week cognitive-behavioral training delivered in a group, via the internet, or to a waitlist control condition. Self-report measures were collected at pre-intervention, post-intervention, 3 m and 12 m follow-up.
Results: Both versions of the preventive intervention signiﬁcantly reduced {RNT} (d ¼ 0.53 to 0.89), and symptom levels of anxiety and depression (d ¼ 0.36 to 0.72). Effects were maintained until 12 m followup. The interventions resulted in a signiﬁcantly lower 12 m prevalence rate of depression (group intervention: 15.3\%, internet intervention: 14.7\%) and generalized anxiety disorder (group intervention: 18.0\%, internet intervention: 16.0\%), compared to the waitlist (32.4\% and 42.2\%, respectively). Mediation analyses demonstrated that reductions in {RNT} mediated the effect of the interventions on the prevalence of depression and generalized anxiety disorder.
Conclusions: Results provide evidence for the efﬁcacy of this preventive intervention targeting {RNT} and support a selective prevention approach that speciﬁcally targets a known risk factor to prevent multiple disorders. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We investigated whether this relaxation of attentional filters by positive affect reduces their selectivity for basic visual features. We induced positive, neutral, or negative affect and asked observers to identify a target motion direction in a series of rapid random moving dot displays. Using a reverse correlation method, we examined the differential effects of emotion on observers’ perceptual tuning curves for motion direction. Here we find that positive affect reduces selectivity for motion direction by broadening observers’ perceptual tuning relative to both neutral and negative affect conditions. These findings provide the first behavioral evidence that positive emotion influences selectivity for basic visual features through modulation of tuning properties.},

	abstract = {The complexities of deﬁning what appears to be the relatively simple concept of resilience are widely recognized. This paper analyses the concept of resilience from a range of disciplinary perspectives and clariﬁes a deﬁnition in order to inform research, policy and practice. The work takes a life course approach to resilience, examining evidence derived from research across the lifespan. It incorporates the methods of systematic review, concept analysis and consultation through face-to-face meetings. The synthesis of methodological approaches enables a clear identiﬁcation of the antecedents, deﬁning attributes and consequences of resilience, validated with stakeholder partners. Through this process, resilience is deﬁned as the process of effectively negotiating, adapting to, or managing signiﬁcant sources of stress or trauma. Assets and resources within the individual, their life and environment facilitate this capacity for adaptation and ‘bouncing back’ in the face of adversity. Across the life course, the experience of resilience will vary. A large proportion of resilience research is routed within the discipline of developmental psychology, and has mainly been developed with children and adolescents. A major contribution to resilience research could be made through more multi-disciplinary studies that examine the dynamics of resilience across the lifespan, its role in healthy ageing and in managing loss, such as changes in cognitive functioning.},

	abstract = {Background: The evaluation of interventions and policies designed to promote resilience, and research to understand the determinants and associations, require reliable and valid measures to ensure data quality. This paper systematically reviews the psychometric rigour of resilience measurement scales developed for use in general and clinical populations.
Methods: Eight electronic abstract databases and the internet were searched and reference lists of all identified papers were hand searched. The focus was to identify peer reviewed journal articles where resilience was a key focus and/or is assessed. Two authors independently extracted data and performed a quality assessment of the scale psychometric properties.
Results: Nineteen resilience measures were reviewed; four of these were refinements of the original measure. All the measures had some missing information regarding the psychometric properties. Overall, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the Resilience Scale for Adults and the Brief Resilience Scale received the best psychometric ratings. The conceptual and theoretical adequacy of a number of the scales was questionable.
Conclusion: We found no current ‘gold standard’ amongst 15 measures of resilience. A number of the scales are in the early stages of development, and all require further validation work. Given increasing interest in resilience from major international funders, key policy makers and practice, researchers are urged to report relevant validation statistics when using the measures.},

	abstract = {Background: The objectives of the study were to explore a self-report measure for psychological well-being and to investigate the relationship between psychological well-being and psychological distress.
Method: Telephone interviews of a representative sample of adults (N = 1933) collected information about sociodemographic variables, a standardised measure of psychological distress, and three brief existing scales to assess aspects of psychological well-being: Positive Relations with Others, Environmental Mastery, and Satisfaction with Life. The total of these three scales was also computed and explored as a measure of overall well-being.
Results: Variables positively associated with psychological well-being were negatively associated with psychological distress and vice versa. For example low psychological well-being and high psychological distress were associated with being the only adult in the household, speaking a language other than English at home, being divorced or separated, having no educational qualifications beyond secondary school, being unable to work, having a low income, renting one’s accommodation, and receiving a pension.
Conclusions: The measure of well-being shows psychometric promise for community surveys. Psychological well-being is not exactly the opposite end of the continuum to psychological distress, but more debate is needed about whether and when, research participants need to be asked questions about both.},

	abstract = {Aim: Although previous reports have addressed worry and rumination as prominent cognitive processes in generalized anxiety disorder ({GAD}) and major depressive disorder ({MDD}) and their distinct correlation with anxious and depressive symptoms, the differential association of worry and rumination with the diagnosis of {GAD} and {MDD} remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the distinct features of worry and rumination in factor structure and their predictive validity for the diagnosis of {GAD} and {MDD}. Methods: Four hundred and sixty-eight patients with {GAD} (n = 148) and {MDD} (n = 320) were enrolled and the diagnoses were conﬁrmed with the Structured Clinical Interview for {DSM}-{IV}. Participants completed the Penn State Worry Questionnaire and Ruminative Response Scale and the severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms was assessed via clinician ratings. Results: In joint factor analysis using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire and Ruminative Response Scale items, worry and rumination emerged as distinct factors. In logistic regression analyses, worry contributed to a higher probability of the diagnosis of {GAD} than rumination, as rumination did in {MDD} than worry. Conclusion: This is the ﬁrst comprehensive study investigating the diagnostic utility of worry and rumination in a well-deﬁned clinical sample of both {GAD} and {MDD}. Our results suggest that worry and rumination are distinct cognitive processes and play a differential role in the diagnosis of {GAD} and {MDD}, distinguishing them at the cognitive level.},

The current study was designed to explore if executive control, speciﬁcally task switching, can be trained in adolescents, what particular aspects of executive control may underlie training and transfer effects, and if acute bouts of exercise directly prior to cognitive training enhance training effects. For that purpose, a task switching training was employed that has been shown to be effective in other age groups. A group of adolescents (10–14 years, n = 20) that received a three-session task switching training was compared to a group (n = 20) that received the same task switching training but who exercised on a stationary bike before each training session. Additionally, a no-contact and an exercise only control group were included (both ns = 20). Analyses indicated that both training groups signiﬁcantly reduced their switching costs over the course of the training sessions for reaction times and error rates, respectively. Analyses indicated transfer to mixing costs in a task switching task that was similar to the one used in training. Far transfer was limited to a choice reaction time task and a tendency for faster reaction times in an updating task. Analyses revealed no additional effects of the exercise intervention. Findings thus indicate that executive control can be enhanced in adolescents through training and that updating may be of particular relevance for the effects of task switching training.},

	abstract = {Background. Many changes in social behavior take place during adolescence. Sexuality and romantic interests emerge during this time, and adolescents spend more time with peers and less time with parents and family. While such changes in social behavior have been well documented in the literature, relatively few neurophysiological explanations for these behavioral changes have been presented.
Method. In this article we selectively review studies documenting (a) the neuronal circuits that are dedicated to the processing of social information ; (b) the changes in social behavior that take place during adolescence ; (c) developmental alterations in the adolescent brain ; and (d) links between the emergence of mood and anxiety disorders in adolescence and changes in brain physiology occurring at that time.
Results. The convergence of evidence from this review indicates a relationship between development of brain physiology and developmental changes in social behavior. Speciﬁcally, the surge of gonadal steroids at puberty induces changes within the limbic system that alters the emotional attributions applied to social stimuli while the gradual maturation of the prefrontal cortex enables increasingly complex and controlled responses to social information.
Conclusions. Observed alterations in adolescent social behavior reﬂect developmental changes in the brain social information processing network. We further speculate that dysregulation of the social information processing network in this critical period may contribute to the onset of mood and anxiety disorders during adolescence.},

We compared the psychopathology networks estimated in each dataset—as well as in ten sets of random split-halves within each dataset—with the goal of quantifying the replicability of the network parameters as they are interpreted in the extant psychopathology network literature. We concluded that current psychopathology network methods have limited replicability both within and between samples, and thus have limited utility. Here we respond to the two commentaries on our target article, concluding that Steinley, Hoffman, Brusco and Sher’s (2017) findings—along with other recent developments in the literature—provide further conclusive evidence that psychopathology networks have poor replicability and utility.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In clinical practice, it is often noted that some individuals struggle with chronic pain, while others find effective means to cope. The purpose of this study was to better understand how resilience fits into coping with persistent pain problems. Of interest was whether measures of resilience add to the prediction of adjustment to chronic pain over and above measures of pain coping as typically used with this patient group. Method: Individuals (N ϭ 101) with chronic pain who attended an initial assessment at a pain clinic completed self-report measures of resilience and coping. Pain related outcome data were also collected. Results: Bivariate correlations indicated that higher resilience was associated with significantly less fear avoidance, less pain-related disability, and lower reported pain intensity. Consistent with theoretical propositions, bivariate analyses also indicated that more resilient individuals with chronic pain reported better social support, and were more likely to be working. Higher resilience was also positively correlated with greater pain self-efficacy. However, when hierarchical regression analyses were performed, resilience did not add significantly to the prediction of depression scores and disability scores, over and above the contribution made by existing measures of pain coping. Conclusion: These findings suggest that, although the construct of resilience appears to have important relationships with various dimensions of chronic pain, as currently operationalized, it does not add significantly to the understanding of chronic-pain adjustment. Rather than abandoning the resilience construct, our findings suggest that resilience as applied to the problem of chronic pain may require a refinement in measurement with this population.},

As hypothesized, the {EEG} gamma band was useful for differentiating worry from baseline and relaxation. During worry induction, {GAD} patients showed higher levels of gamma activity than control participants in posterior electrode sites that have been previously associated with negative emotion. Gamma fluctuations in these electrode sites were correlated with subjective emotional experience ratings lending additional support to interpretations of negative affect. Following 14 weeks of psychotherapy, the {GAD} group reported less negative affect with worry inductions and the corresponding gamma sites that previously differentiated the clinical from control groups changed for the {GAD} patients in the direction of control participants. These findings suggest converging evidence that patients suffering from {GAD} experience more negative emotion during worry and that the {EEG} gamma band is useful for monitoring fluctuations in pathological worry expected to follow successful treatment.},

We hypothesize that high {WMC} individuals are more likely to utilize proactive control yielding not only benefits, but also specific costs to performance. Across two separate, large-sample experiments, healthy young adults performed different variants of the {AX}-{CPT} context processing task, a well-established probe of proactive and reactive cognitive control. In two experiments, {WMC} predicted both improvements and relative impairments in task performance in a manner that was consistent with usage of proactive control. These findings suggest that individuals differ in the degree to which they utilize proactive control based on {WMC}.},

	abstract = {Anxiety prepares an organism for dealing with threats by recruiting cognitive resources to process information about the threat, and by engaging physiological systems to prepare a response. Heightened trait anxiety is associated with biases in both these processes: high trait-anxious individuals tend to report heightened risk perceptions, and inappropriate engagement in danger mitigation behavior. However, no research has addressed whether the calibration between risk perception and danger mitigation behavior is affected by anxiety, though it is well recognized that this calibration is crucial for adaptive functioning. The current study aimed to examine whether anxiety is characterized by better or worse calibration of danger mitigation behavior to variations in risk magnitude. Low and high trait-anxious participants were presented with information about the likelihood and severity of a danger (loud noise burst) on each trial. Participants could decide to mitigate this danger by investing a virtual coin, at the cost of losing danger mitigation ability on subsequent trials. Importantly, level of risk likelihood and severity were varied independently, and the multiplicative relationship between the 2 defined total danger. Multilevel modeling showed that the magnitude of total danger predicted the probability of coin investments, over and above the effects of risk likelihood and severity, suggesting that participants calibrated their danger mitigation behavior to integrated risk information. Crucially, this calibration was affected by trait anxiety, indicating better calibration in high trait-anxious individuals. These results are discussed in light of existing knowledge and models of the effect of anxiety on risk perception and decision-making.},

	abstract = {Attentional bias modiﬁcation ({ABM}) is a promising therapeutic tool aimed at changing patterns of attentional selectivity associated with heightened anxiety. A number of studies have successfully implemented {ABM} using the modiﬁed dot-probe task. However others have not achieved the attentional change required to achieve emotional beneﬁts, highlighting the need for new {ABM} methods. The current study compared the effectiveness of a newly developed {ABM} task against the traditional dot-probe {ABM} task. The new person-identity-matching ({PIM}) task presented participants with virtual cards, each depicting a happy and angry person. The task encourages selective attention toward or away from threat by requiring participants to make matching judgements between two cards, based either on the identities of the happy faces, or of the angry faces. Change in attentional bias achieved by both {ABM} tasks was measured by a dot-probe assessment task. Their impact on emotional vulnerability was assessed by measuring negative emotional reactions to a video stressor. The {PIM} task succeeded in modifying attentional bias, and exerting an impact on emotional reactivity, whereas this was not the case for the dot-probe task. These results are considered in relation to the potential clinical utility of the current task in comparison to traditional {ABM} methodologies.},

When threat cues signal dangers that can be mitigated through behavioural action, vigilance for these threat cues can have an adaptive function. It is unknown, however, whether the anxiety-linked attentional bias is maintained or eliminated in contexts where threat cues signal dangers that can be mitigated. The current study used a probe task to assess anxiety-linked attentional bias to threat cues signalling a danger (noise burst) that in one condition could and in another condition could not be mitigated. Results showed that high trait anxious participants exhibited a larger attentional bias to threat than low trait anxious participants, and importantly, this anxiety-linked attentional bias did not differ as a function of danger mitigability. These findings suggest that anxiety-linked attentional bias is a rather pervasive processing style that may be insensitive to contextual variation in the adaptiveness of attending to threat.},

	abstract = {Objective: Heightened trait anxiety is associated with impaired behavioural preparedness for natural hazards. However, little is known about the mechanisms that contribute to this association. Research has shown that trait anxiety is associated with an attentional bias ({AB}) towards threat-relevant information, and some researchers have suggested that such vigilance could exacerbate the detrimental effect of trait anxiety on behavioural preparedness. Conversely, given the potentially adaptive role of {AB} in promoting engagement in danger mitigation behaviour, it is also possible that {AB} could ameliorate the negative association between anxiety and preparedness. The aim of this study was to discriminate the validity of these two hypotheses. Method: Participants were recruited from a bushﬁre-prone community in Western Australia and were assessed on measures of trait anxiety, {AB} to threat, and current bushﬁre preparedness. Results: As predicted, the results showed a negative correlation between trait anxiety and bushﬁre preparedness, and a positive correlation between trait anxiety and {AB} to bushﬁre-related threat. Furthermore, the negative relationship between trait anxiety and preparedness was moderated by this {AB} to bushﬁre-related threat, with the direction of this moderation showing that {AB} further exacerbated this negative relationship. Conclusions: This study is the ﬁrst to show that in a situation where people are exposed to a real-world danger that can be mitigated through appropriate engagement in speciﬁc preparatory behaviours, {AB} to danger-relevant threat serves to strengthen the observed negative association between trait anxiety and behavioural preparedness. Implications of these ﬁndings are discussed.},

Elevated inﬂammation, a common risk factor across diseases of aging, may play a key role in the relationship between anxiety and physical disease. However, the neurobiological mechanisms linking anxiety with elevated inﬂammation remain unclear. In this review, we present a neurobiological model of the mechanisms by which anxiety promotes inﬂammation. Speciﬁcally we propose that exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat in anxious individuals may lead to sustained threat perception, which is accompanied by prolonged activation of threat-related neural circuitry and threat-responsive biological systems including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA}) axis, autonomic nervous system ({ANS}), and inﬂammatory response. Over time, this pattern of responding can promote chronic inﬂammation through structural and functional brain changes, altered sensitivity of immune cell receptors, dysregulation of the {HPA} axis and {ANS}, and accelerated cellular aging. Chronic inﬂammation, in turn, increases risk for diseases of aging. Exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat may thus be a treatment target for reducing disease risk in anxious individuals.},

In the present study, factor structure of the {ACS} and its relationship with symptoms of anxiety and depression was investigated in a total sample of 728 Icelandic university students. Exploratory factor analysis in sample 1 (n = 361), yielded two factors, labeled focusing and shifting. Conﬁrmatory factor analysis in sample 2 (n = 367) showed a reasonable ﬁt of this two factor model. The two factors correlated strongly (0.73). The two subscales showed different predictive validity in a set of hierarchical regression analyses where the focusing subscale made a significant prediction of anxiety scores when depression scores were controlled for, and the shifting subscale signiﬁcant prediction of depression scores when anxiety scores were controlled for.

This paper presents a questionnaire-based study in healthy young adults for the purpose of exploring individual differences that contribute to the sense of well-being and to identify characteristics of ﬂourishing versus nonﬂourishing individuals in terms of nonlinear dynamical systems concepts. Methods: Young adult college students (N ϭ 856) completed questionnaires assessing global well-being (Arizona Integrative Outcomes Scale [{AIOS}]), global physical health, positive and negative mood (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [{PANAS}]), resilience (Connor- Davidson Resilience Scale), and repressive defensiveness. Next, subjects were divided into ﬂourisher/languisher groups by a previously determined ratio of positive/negative scores established by a study using complex systems methods. Results: Positive-to-negative affect (P:N) ratio accounted for more variance in {AIOS} (R2 ϭ 0.19; P Ͻ .001) than did separate positive or negative {PANAS} scores or physical health. Flourishers (14.5\% of the sample) were signiﬁcantly higher than languishers in defensiveness and resilience. Conclusions: Positive-to-negative affect explains a substantial portion of the variance in well-being of healthy young adults. The low percentage of ﬂourishers in this nonclinical sample is consistent with previous population-based studies and suggests that ﬂourishers are a minority, even in nonclinical settings. Positive-to-negative affect may be a useful variable for subsequent prospective studies of applied {WSCAM} treatments and in well and clinical populations. The well-being measure used in this study is easy to complete, sensitive, and may be a useful clinical measure to track change with treatment over time.},

However, it is unclear how such cognitive control deficits are modulated by task demands and by the emotionality of the distractors. A sample of 31 participants (25 female) completed a novel flanker task with emotional and neutral distractors under lowand high-cognitive-load conditions. The negative-going N2 event-related potential was measured to index participants’ level of top-down resource allocation in the inhibition of distractors under high- and low-load conditions. Results showed N2 amplitudes were larger under high- compared with low-load conditions. In addition, under high but not low load, trait worry was associated with greater N2 amplitudes. Our findings support {ACT} predictions that trait worry adversely affects goal-directed behavior, and is associated with greater recruitment of cognitive resources to inhibit the impact of distracting information under conditions in which cognitive resources are taxed.},

This lateralized readiness potential ({LRP}) starts even before the response is emitted, and its onset has been taken as a measure of the time at which the brain began preparing to make the response. The {LRP} has also been used to measure the preliminary activation of a response that is never actually produced. The {LRP} is a valuable measure of relatively central response activation that is now widely used in many areas of psychology involving reaction time tasks.

In a series of experiments, we explored the relationship between recognition of emotion in ambiguous facial expressions and aggressive thoughts and behavior, both in healthy adults and in adolescent youth at high risk of criminal offending and delinquency. We show that it is possible to experimentally modify biases in emotion recognition to encourage the perception of happiness over anger in ambiguous expressions. This change in perception results in a decrease in self-reported anger and aggression in healthy adults and high-risk youth, respectively, and also in independently rated aggressive behavior in high-risk youth. We obtained similar effects on mood using two different techniques to modify biases in emotion perception (feedback-based training and visual adaptation). These studies provide strong evidence that emotion processing plays a causal role in anger and the maintenance of aggressive behavior.},

	abstract = {Despite the established evidence for threat-related attention bias in anxiety, the mechanisms underlying this bias remain unclear. One important unresolved question is whether disorder-congruent threats capture attention to a greater extent than do more general or disorder-incongruent threat stimuli. Evidence for attention bias speciﬁcity in anxiety would implicate involvement of previous learning and memory processes in threat-related attention bias, whereas lack of content speciﬁcity would point to perturbations in more generic attention processes. Enhanced clarity of mechanism could have clinical implications for the stimuli types used in Attention Bias Modiﬁcation Treatments ({ABMT}). Content speciﬁcity of threat-related attention bias in anxiety and potential moderators of this effect were investigated. A systematic search identiﬁed 37 samples from 29 articles (N = 866). Relevant data were extracted based on speciﬁc coding rules, and Cohen's d effect size was used to estimate bias speciﬁcity effects. The results indicate greater attention bias toward disorder-congruent relative to disorderincongruent threat stimuli (d = 0.28, p b 0.0001). This effect was not moderated by age, type of anxiety disorder, visual attention tasks, or type of disorder-incongruent stimuli. No evidence of publication bias was observed. Implications for threat bias in anxiety and {ABMT} are discussed.},

In these studies, a stable trajectory of positive health or resilience is almost always the modal outcome (Bonanno, 2004; Bonanno et al., 2011). Infurna and Luthar (2016, this issue) reported that they replicated findings from two early studies in which trajectories of subjective well-being were identified before and after divorce, widowhood, and unemployment (Galatzer-Levy, Bonanno, \& Mancini, 2010; Mancini, Bonanno, \& Clark, 2011) and then reanalyzed these data in such a way to conclude a decrease in the prevalence of resilience. In this commentary, we discuss three serious flaws in Infurna and Luthar’s claims. First, they did not actually replicate our original analyses. They used different data, time points, and parameters. Second, the model specifications in their reanalyses were not optimal because they increased variance, reduced variability in response to the stressor, and had lower entropy, indicating that their models more poorly captured unique patterns of response. Third, their reanalyses were theoretically uninformative as they minimized both group differences and overall responses to the stressor event and thus failed to identify widely acknowledged populations, such as chronic stress reactivity.},

	abstract = {Impairment in mental ﬂexibility may be a key component contributing to cardinal cognitive symptoms among mood disorders patients, particularly thought control disorders. Impaired ability to switch from one thought to another might reﬂect difﬁculties in either generating new mental states, inhibiting previous states, or both. However, the neural underpinnings of impaired cognitive ﬂexibility in mood disorders remain largely unresolved. We compared a group of mood disorders patients (n 5 29) and a group of matched healthy subjects (n 5 32) on a novel task-switching paradigm involving happy and sad faces, that allowed us to separate generation of a new mental set (Switch Cost) and inhibition of the previous set during switching (Inhibition Cost), using {fMRI}. Behavioral data showed a larger Switch Cost in patients relative to controls, but the average Inhibition Cost did not differ between groups. At the neural level, a main effect of group was found with stronger activation of the subgenual cingulate cortex in patients. The larger Switch Cost in patients was reﬂected by a stronger recruitment of brain regions involved in attention and executive control, including the left intraparietal sulcus, precuneus, left inferior fontal gyrus, and right anterior cingulate. Critically, activity in the subgenual cingulate cortex was not downregulated by inhibition in patients relative to controls. In conclusion, mood disorder patients have exaggerated Switch Cost relative to controls, and this deﬁcit in cognitive ﬂexibility is associated with increased activation of the fronto-parietal attention networks, combined with impaired modulation of the subgenual cingulate cortex when inhibition of previous mental states is needed.

	abstract = {Depression is one of the most common mental health problems in childhood and adolescence. Although data consistently show it is associated with self-reported negative cognitive styles, less is known about the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Cognitive biases in attention, interpretation and memory represent plausible mechanisms and are known to characterise adult depression. We provide the ﬁrst structured review of studies investigating the nature and causal role of cognitive biases in youth depression. Key questions are (i) do cognitive biases characterise youth depression? (ii) are cognitive biases a vulnerability factor for youth depression? and (iii) do cognitive biases play a causal role in youth depression? We ﬁnd consistent evidence for positive associations between attention and interpretation biases and youth depression. Stronger biases in youth with an elevated risk of depression support cognitive-vulnerability models. Preliminary evidence from cognitive bias modiﬁcation paradigms supports a causal role of attention and interpretation biases in youth depression but these paradigms require testing in clinical samples before they can be considered treatment tools. Studies of memory biases in youth samples have produced mixed ﬁndings and none have investigated the causal role of memory bias. We identify numerous areas for future research in this emerging ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {The notion that some people are more vulnerable to adversity as a function of inherent risk characteristics is widely embraced in most fields of psychology. This is reflected in the popularity of the diathesis-stress framework, which has received a vast amount of empirical support over the years. Much less effort has been directed toward the investigation of endogenous factors associated with variability in response to positive influences. One reason for the failure to investigate individual differences in response to positive experiences as a function of endogenous factors may be the absence of adequate theoretical frameworks. According to the differential-susceptibility hypothesis, individuals generally vary in their developmental plasticity regardless of whether they are exposed to negative or positive influences—a notion derived from evolutionary reasoning. On the basis of this now well-supported proposition, we advance herein the new concept of vantage sensitivity, reflecting variation in response to exclusively positive experiences as a function of individual endogenous characteristics. After distinguishing vantage sensitivity from theoretically related concepts of differential-susceptibility and resilience, we review some recent empirical evidence for vantage sensitivity featuring behavioral, physiological, and genetic factors as moderators of a wide range of positive experiences ranging from family environment and psychotherapy to educational intervention. Thereafter, we discuss genetic and environmental factors contributing to individual differences in vantage sensitivity, potential mechanisms underlying vantage sensitivity, and practical implications.},

	abstract = {A large number of gene–environment interaction studies provide evidence that some people are more likely to be negatively affected by adverse experiences as a function of speciﬁc genetic variants. However, such “risk” variants are surprisingly frequent in the population. Evolutionary analysis suggests that genetic variants associated with increased risk for maladaptive development under adverse environmental conditions are maintained in the population because they are also associated with advantages in response to different contextual conditions. These advantages may include (a) coexisting genetic resilience pertaining to other adverse inﬂuences, (b) a general genetic susceptibility to both low and high environmental quality, and (c) a coexisting propensity to beneﬁt disproportionately from positive and supportive exposures, as reﬂected in the recent framework of vantage sensitivity. After introducing the basic properties of vantage sensitivity and highlighting conceptual similarities and differences with diathesis-stress and differential susceptibility patterns of gene–environment interaction, selected and recent empirical evidence for the notion of vantage sensitivity as a function of genetic differences is reviewed. The unique contribution that the new perspective of vantage sensitivity may make to our understanding of social inequality will be discussed after suggesting neurocognitive and molecular mechanisms hypothesized to underlie the propensity to beneﬁt disproportionately from benevolent experiences.},

The past years have resulted in over 40 scientific publications and numerous conference symposia and workshops. Now is an excellent moment to take stock of the network approach: what are its most fundamental challenges, and what are potential ways forward in addressing them? After a brief conceptual introduction, we first discuss challenges to network theory: (1) What is the validity of the network approach beyond some commonly investigated disorders such as major depression? (2) How do we best define psychopathological networks and their constituent elements? (3) And how can we gain a better understanding of the causal nature and real-life underpinnings of associations among symptoms? Next, after a short technical introduction to network modeling, we discuss challenges to network methodology: (4) Heterogeneity of samples studied with network analytic models; and (5) a lurking replicability crisis in this strongly data-driven and exploratory field. Addressing these challenges may propel the network approach from its adolescence into adulthood, and promises advances in understanding psychopathology both at the nomothetic and idiographic level.},

Despite its popularity, very few published studies have examined psychometric properties of the task, including test-retest reliability, and no previous study has examined reliability in clinically anxious samples or systematically explored the effects of task design and analysis decisions on reliability. In the current analysis, we utilized dot-probe data from three studies where attention bias towards threat-related faces was assessed at multiple (≥5) timepoints. Two of the studies were similar (adults with Social Anxiety Disorder, similar design features) while one was much more disparate (pediatric healthy volunteers, distinct task design). We explored the effects of analysis choices (e.g., bias score calculation formula, methods for outlier handling) on reliability and searched for convergence of findings across the three studies. We found that, when considering the three studies concurrently, the most reliable {RT} bias index utilized data from dot-bottom trials, comparing congruent to incongruent trials, with rescaled outliers, particularly after averaging across more than one assessment point. Although reliability of {RT} bias indices was moderate to low under most circumstances, within-session variability in bias (attention bias variability; {ABV}), a recently proposed {RT} index, was more reliable across sessions. Several eyetracking-based indices of attention bias (available in the pediatric healthy sample only) showed reliability that matched the optimal {RT} index ({ABV}). On the basis of these findings, we make specific recommendations to researchers using the dot probe, particularly those wishing to investigate individual differences and/or single-patient applications.},

There are a number of tools available to measure wellness, each with its own focus, depending on the definition or model from which it was developed.

The majority of wellness evaluation approaches used with adolescent populations have less than ideal validation. A ‘gold standard’ definition could lead to the standardisation of a theoretical model against which wellness instruments could be validated.

For example, visual attention acts as a gateway to awareness, raising the question of whether happy and satisfied people attend to (and therefore see) the world differently. Previous work suggests that biases in selective attention are associated with both trait negativity and with positive affect states, but to our knowledge, no previous work has explored whether trait-happy individuals attend to the world differently. Here, we employed eye tracking as a continuous measure of sustained overt attention during passive viewing of displays containing positive and neutral photographs to determine whether selective attention to positive scenes is associated with measures of trait happiness and life satisfaction. Both trait measures were significantly correlated with selective attention for positive (vs. neutral) scenes, and this general pattern was robust across several types of positive stimuli (achievement, social, and primary reward), and not because of positive or negative state affect. Such effects were especially prominent during the later phases of sustained viewing. This suggests that people who are happy and satisfied with life may literally see the world in a more positive light, as if through rose-colored glasses. Future work should investigate the causal relationship between such attention biases and one’s happiness and life satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Reliability in classical test theory is a population-dependent concept, defined as a ratio of true-score variance and observed-score variance, where observed-score variance is a sum of true and error components. On the other hand, the power of a statistical significance test is a function of the total variance, irrespective of its decomposition into true and error components. For that reason, the reliability of a dependent variable is a function of the ratio of true-score variance and observed-score variance, whereas statistical power is a function of the sum of the same two variances. Controversies about how reliability is related to statistical power often can be explained by authors’ use of the term “reliability” in a general way to mean “consistency,” “precision,” or “dependability,” which does not always correspond to its mathematical definition as a variance ratio. The present note shows how adherence to the mathematical definition can help resolve the issue and presents some derivations and illustrative examples that have further implications for significance testing and practical research.},

	abstract = {The growing literature conceptualizing mental disorders like posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) as networks of interacting symptoms faces three key challenges. Prior studies predominantly used (a) small samples with low power for precise estimation, (b) nonclinical samples, and (c) single samples. This renders network structures in clinical data, and the extent to which networks replicate across data sets, unknown. To overcome these limitations, the present cross-cultural multisite study estimated regularized partial correlation networks of 16 {PTSD} symptoms across four data sets of traumatized patients receiving treatment for {PTSD} (total N = 2,782). Despite differences in culture, trauma type, and severity of the samples, considerable similarities emerged, with moderate to high correlations between symptom profiles (0.43–0.82), network structures (0.62–0.74), and centrality estimates (0.63–0.75). We discuss the importance of future replicability efforts to improve clinical psychological science and provide code, model output, and correlation matrices to make the results of this article fully reproducible.},

	abstract = {Theoretical frameworks of anxiety propose that attentional biases to threat-related stimuli cause or maintain anxious states. The current paper draws on theoretical frameworks and key empirical studies to outline the distinctive attentional processes highlighted as being important in understanding anxiety. We develop a conceptual framework to make a distinction between two attentional biases: selective attention to threat and hypervigilance for threat. We suggest that these biases each have a different purpose and can account for the typical patterns of facilitated and impaired attention evident in anxious individuals. The framework is novel in its speciﬁcation of the eye movement behavior associated with these attentional biases. We highlight that selective attention involves narrowing overt attention onto threat to ensure that these stimuli receive processing priority, leading to rapid engagement with task-relevant threat and delayed disengagement from task-irrelevant threat. We show that hypervigilance operates in the presence and absence of threat and involves monitoring for potential dangers via attentional broadening or excessive scanning of the environment with numerous eye movements, leading to improved threat detection and increased distraction from task-irrelevant threat. We conclude that future research could usefully employ eye movement measures to more clearly understand the diverse roles of attention in anxiety.},

	abstract = {Persistent complex bereavement disorder ({PCBD}) is a bereavement-specific syndrome characterized by prolonged and impairing grief. Most research on this syndrome rests on the traditional latent variable model whereby symptoms reflect an underlying entity. The network (or causal system) approach offers an alternative framework for understanding {PCBD} that does not suffer from limitations inherent in the latent entity approach. The network approach to psychopathology conceptualizes the relation between symptoms and disorder as mereological, not reflective. That is, symptoms do not reflect an inferred, unobservable category or dimension, but rather are themselves constitutive of the disorder. Accordingly, we propose that {PCBD} constitutes a causal system of mutually reinforcing symptoms that arise following the death of a loved one and settle into a pathological equilibrium. In this study, we used data from the Changing Lives of Older Couples ({CLOC}) database to identify symptoms central to {PCBD}, distinguish the {PCBD} network from an overlapping but distinct network of depression symptoms, and examine how previously identified risk factors may contribute to the maintenance or development of {PCBD}. Together, these findings provide an important first step toward understanding the nature and etiology of the {PCBD} network.},

Results of confirmatory factor analyses supported this 3-factor model of psychological, social, and emotional well-being, consisting of 14 subdimensions. Furthermore, this model was found to be invariant for men and women in both samples. The secondary purpose was to assess the effectiveness of personal growth initiative ({PGI}; C. Robitschek, 1998) as a parsimonious predictor (i.e., 1 predictor for many outcomes) of these multiple dimensions of mental health. Results of structural equation modeling supported {PGI} as a parsimonious predictor of Keyes’s multidimensional mental health model for men and women in both groups. Limitations are discussed, and implications for research and practice in counseling psychology are presented.},

Method: Electronic and manual literature search of {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE} and {PSYCHINFO}, using a range of search terms around biological and psychological factors inﬂuencing resilience as observed in human and experimental animal studies, complemented by review articles and cross-references.
Results: The term resilience is used in the literature for diﬀerent phenomena ranging from prevention of mental health disturbance to successful adaptation and swift recovery after experiencing life adversities, and may also include post-traumatic psychological growth. Secure attachment, experiencing positive emotions and having a purpose in life are three important psychological building blocks of resilience. Overlap between psychological and biological ﬁndings on resilience in the literature is most apparent for the topic of stress sensitivity, although recent results suggest a crucial role for reward experience in resilience.
Conclusion: Improving the understanding of the links between genetic endowment, environmental impact and gene–environment interactions with developmental psychology and biology is crucial for elucidating the neurobiological and psychological underpinnings of resilience.},

Resilience is an inference based on evidence that some individuals have a better outcome than others who have experienced a comparable level of adversity; moreover, the negative experience may have either a sensitizing effect or a strengthening “steeling” effect in relation to the response to later stress or adversity. After noting the crucial importance of first testing for the environmental mediation of risk through “natural experiments,” findings are reviewed on “steeling effects” in animal models and humans. Gene–environment interaction findings are considered, and it is noted that there is some evidence that the genetic influences concerns responsivity to all environments and not just bad ones. Life course effects are reviewed in relation to evidence on turning point effects associated with experiences that increase opportunities and enhance coping. Attention is drawn to both research implications and substantive findings as features that foster resilience.},

Considering the causal role of this interpretive bias in anxiety, it was recently established that modifying interpretive biases inﬂuences anxiety. This suggests that anxiety can be clinically treated by directly targeting this interpretive bias. The present study was designed to modify a negative interpretive bias in highly anxious individuals, and subsequently assess the hypothesized beneﬁcial effects on clinical measures. High trait-anxious participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a positive interpretational Cognitive Bias Modiﬁcation ({CBM}-I) or a control condition (n = 2 Â 17). The program was offered online for eight consecutive days. Upon completing the program, participants who had followed positive {CBM}-I were less state and trait-anxious compared to the control group. Additionally, positively trained participants scored lower on a measure of general psychopathology ({SCL}-90). No effects were observed on social anxiety and stress vulnerability. The mixed pattern of ﬁndings renders them rather inconclusive, leaving interpretations of the potential therapeutic merits of {CBM}-I open for future research.},

Second, different versions of the dot probe task have been used with unknown relative merits. Participants ðN ¼ 133Þ completed two versions of the dot probe task: the detection task (i.e. is there a probe?) and the differentiation task (i.e. what sort of probe is it?). The analysis carried out allowed for a differentiation between orienting and disengagement. The main ﬁnding was that trait anxiety is related to disengagement difﬁculties and not to speed of orienting. Concerning the relative merits of the two dot probe task versions, the results suggest that the detection task may be superior to the differentiation task.

We also include scales developed or adapted for children and adolescents. In the extant literature, measures of repetitive thinking generally show small-to-moderate correlations with measures of psychopathology. This review highlights problems with the content validity of existing instruments; for example, confounds between repetitive thought and symptomatology, metacognitive beliefs, and affect. This review also builds on previous reviews by including newer transdiagnostic measures of repetitive thinking. We hope that this review will help to expand our understanding of repetitive thinking beyond the mood and anxiety disorders, and suggest ways forward in the measurement of repetitive thinking in individuals with comorbid conditions.},

Faces were selected from the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces ({KDEF}) database (Lundqvist, Flykt, \& Öhman, 1998). In the positive {MIP} condition, analyses revealed a mood-congruent relation between positive mood and greater attentional deployment to happy faces. In the negative {MIP} condition, however, analyses revealed a mood-incongruent relation between increased negative mood and greater attentional deployment to happy faces. Furthermore, attentional deployment to happy faces after the negative {MIP} predicted participants’ mood recovery at the end of the experimental session.

A neurodevelopmental perspective on mindfulness has been advocated as a powerful tool to enhance our understanding of underlying neurocognitive changes that have implications for developmental well-being research and the implementation of mindfulness in education. To stimulate more research in the developmental cognitive neuroscience of mindfulness, this article outlines possible indexes of mindfulness-based change in adolescence, with a focus on event-related brain potential ({ERP}) markers. We provide methodological recommendations for future studies and offer examples of research paradigms. We also discuss how mindfulness practice could impact on the development of prefrontal brain structures and enhance attention control and emotion regulation skills in adolescents, impacting in turn on their self-regulation and coping skills. We highlight advantages of the {ERP} methodology in neurodevelopmental research of mindfulness. It is proposed that research using established experimental tasks targeting {ERP} components such as the contingent negative variability, N200, error-related negativity and error positivity, P300, and late positive potential could elucidate developmentally salient shifts in the neural plasticity of the adolescent brain induced by mindfulness practice.},

Another relevant aspect is the preventative character of the proposed interventions by positive psychology by the fact that increase well-being and produce elements such as resilience and coping resources that reduce the recurrent relapses in the treatment of depression. The strategies of positive psychology, such as increasing positive emotions, develop personal strengths: seeking direction, meaning and engagement for the day-to-day life of the patients, appear as potentially tools for the prophylaxis and treatment of depression, helping to reduce signs and symptoms as well as for prevention of relapses.},

Here, we examined the beneficial effects of working memory training on attentional control in pre-selected high trait anxious individuals who underwent a three week daily training intervention using the adaptive dual n-back task. Pre and post outcome measures of attentional control were assessed using a Flanker task that included a stress induction and an emotional Antisaccade task (with angry and neutral faces as target). Resting state {EEG} (Theta/Beta ratio) was recorded to as a neural marker of trait attentional control. Our results showed that adaptive working memory training improved attentional control with transfer effects on the Flanker task and resting state {EEG}, but effects of training on the Antisaccade task were less conclusive.},

Participants performed a change detection task before and after the worry/control manipulation. Mediation analyses showed that the level of self-reported worry mediated the effects of condition on change in {WMC} as demonstrated by the signiﬁcant indirect effect of worry and the resulting nonsigniﬁcant direct effect of condition on change in {WMC}. Similar results were obtained when using state anxiety measures as mediating factors.

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Attentional processes have been suggested to play a crucial role in resilience deﬁned as positive adaptation facing adversity. However, research is lacking on associations between attentional biases to positive and threat-related stimuli, attentional control and trait resilience.
Methods: Data stem from the follow-up assessment of a longitudinal study investigating mental health and related factors among German soldiers. Trait resilience was assessed with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and attentional control with the Attentional Control Scale. A subset of n ¼ 198 soldiers also completed a dot probe task with happy, neutral and threatening faces.
Results: Attentional control was positively related to trait resilience. Results revealed no associations between both attentional biases and trait resilience. However, there was a negative association between attentional bias to threat and trait resilience when attentional control was low and a positive association between attentional bias to threat and trait resilience when attentional control was high. No such associations were found for attentional bias to positive stimuli. Limitations: Generalizability to other populations may be limited since we exclusively focused on male soldiers. Also, the cross-sectional design does not allow for causal conclusions.
Conclusions: Findings suggest that attentional processing may promote trait resilience. Future research on preventive interventions should consider these ﬁndings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Several studies have shown that threatening stimuli are prioritized by the visual system. In the present study we investigated whether a stimulus associated with a threat of electrical shock attracts attention and accordingly interferes with the execution of voluntary eye movements to other locations. In 2 experiments, we showed that when a fear-conditioned and a neutral stimulus were presented simultaneously, voluntary saccades were initiated faster toward fear-conditioned compared with neutral stimuli. Moreover, saccades often erroneously went to the location of threat even when a saccade to a different location was required. This implies an automatic shift of attention to a fear-conditioned stimulus that interferes with saccade execution. The same pattern of results was found for a neutral stimulus that was always presented together with the fear-conditioned stimulus and consequently itself became associated with threat. The current results indicate that threatening stimuli attract visual attention and subsequently bias saccade target selection in a reflexive fashion.},

We advocate a third interpretation, in which attributes are conceptualized as systems of causally coupled (observable) variables. In such a view, a construct like ’depression’ is not seen as a latent variable that underlies symptoms like ’lack of sleep’ or ’fatigue’, and neither as a composite constructed out of these symptoms, but as a system of causal relations between the symptoms themselves (e.g., lack of sleep / fatigue, etc.). We discuss methodological strategies to investigate such systems as well as theoretical consequences that bear on the question in which sense such a construct could be interpreted as real.},

The current study utilized eye-movement data to examine the time-course of visual attention over 1500 ms trials of a probe detection task. Nineteen participants with a primary diagnosis of social phobia based on {DSM}-{IV} criteria and 20 non-clinical controls completed this task with angry, fearful, and happy face trials. Overt visual attention to the emotional and neutral faces was measured in 50 ms segments across the trial. Over time, participants with social phobia attend less to emotional faces and speciﬁcally less to happy faces compared to controls. Further, attention to emotional relative to neutral expressions did not vary notably by emotion for participants with social phobia, but control participants showed a pattern after 1000 ms in which over time they preferentially attended to happy expressions and avoided negative expressions. Findings highlight the importance of considering attention biases to positive stimuli as well as the pattern of attention between groups. These results suggest that attention “bias” in social phobia may be driven by a relative lack of the biases seen in non-anxious participants.},

The present study used a dual target rapid visual presentation paradigm to examine the temporal allocation of attention to facial expressions of anger and happiness in 16 Palestinian victims of torture with {PTSD} and 16 control subjects. Findings revealed that signals of threat seem to interfere with already processed information in individuals suffering from {PTSD}.

In their paper, they offer a conceptual analysis of the relationship between reliability, power and replicability, and then provide a series of recommendations for researchers interested in using implicit measures in an experimental setting. At the core of their account is the idea that reliability can be equated with statistical power, such that “lower levels of reliability are associated with decreasing probabilities of detecting a statistically signiﬁcant effect, given one exists in the population” (p. 573). They also take the additional step of equating reliability and replicability. In our commentary, we draw attention to the fact that there is no direct, ﬁxed or one-to-one relation between reliability and power or replicability. More speciﬁcally, we argue that when adopting an experimental (rather than a correlational) approach, researchers strive to minimize inter-individual variation, which has a direct impact on sample based reliability estimates. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the {LeBel} and Paunonen’s recommendations and reﬁne them where appropriate.},

Forty-five participants received {WM} training using either emotional or neutral material, or an undemanding control task. {WM} training, regardless of training material, led to transfer gains on another {WM} task and in fluid intelligence. However, only brain-training with emotional material yielded transferable gains to improved control over affective information on an emotional Stroop task. The data support the reality of transferable benefits of demanding {WM} training and suggest that transferable gains across to affective contexts require training with material congruent to those contexts. These findings constitute preliminary evidence that intensive cognitively demanding brain-training can improve not only our abstract problem-solving capacity, but also ameliorate cognitive control processes (e.g. decision-making) in our daily emotive environments.},

Empirical identification of pathways, or histories, requires measures that assess cumulative wear and tear on physiological systems following from psychosocial adversity and genetic predispositions. Such an assessment, allostatic load, has been shown to predict later life mortality, incident cardiovascular disease, and decline in physical and cognitive functioning. Using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study ({WLS}), we seek precursors to allostatic load via ordered categories of cumulative adversity relative to advantage over the life course. We operationalize these histories via unfolding economic circumstances and social relationship experiences (e.g., parent–child interactions, quality of spousal ties). Findings reveal a strong direct association between the extent of adversity relative to advantage in an ordering of these histories and likelihood of high allostatic load. Importantly, resilient individuals with economic disadvantage, but compensating positive social relationship histories also show low prevalence of high allostatic load.},

Here, we used this approach to explore the visual representation of facial expressions of emotion. Participants were adapted to anti-expressions of six facial expressions. The participants were then shown an average face and asked to classify the face’s expression using one of six basic emotion descriptors. Participants chose the emotion matching the antiexpression they were adapted to significantly more often than they chose any other emotion (e.g., if they were adapted to antifear, they classified the emotion on the average face as fear). The strength of this aftereffect of adaptation decreased as the strength of the anti-expression adapter decreased. These findings provide evidence that visual representations of facial expressions of emotion are coded with reference to a prototype within a multidimensional framework.},

Previous resilience measures assess resources that may promote resilience rather than recovery, resistance, adaptation, or thriving. Purpose: To test a new brief resilience scale. Method: The brief resilience scale ({BRS}) was created to assess the ability to bounce back or recover from stress. Its psychometric characteristics were examined in four samples, including two student samples and samples with cardiac and chronic pain patients. Results: The {BRS} was reliable and measured as a unitary construct. It was predictably related to personal characteristics, social relations, coping, and health in all samples. It was negatively related to anxiety, depression, negative affect, and physical symptoms when other resilience measures and optimism, social support, and Type D personality (high negative affect and high social inhibition) were controlled. There were large differences in {BRS} scores between cardiac patients with and without Type D and women with and without ﬁbromyalgia. Conclusion: The {BRS} is a reliable means of assessing resilience as the ability to bounce back or recover from stress and may provide unique and important information about people coping with health-related stressors.},

This research approach and these data allow investigation of a number of research questions not amenable to other data collection methods. Examples of research questions uniquely suited for {EMA} data include, but are not limited to: (1) the comparison of retrospective data to momentary data; (2) evaluation of physiological and psychosocial processes in the natural environment; (3) the relation of symptoms and other disease processes to characteristics of the natural environment; and (4) examination of dynamic changes in psychosocial variables that may mediate improvement following treatment.

Investigating the development of these factors in adolescence will help to improve understanding of emotional vulnerability and resilience. The {CogBIAS} longitudinal study ({CogBIAS}-L-S) aims to combine cognitive and genetic approaches to investigate risk and protective factors associated with the development of mood and impulsivity-related outcomes in an adolescent sample. Methods: {CogBIAS}-L-S is a three-wave longitudinal study of typically developing adolescents conducted over 4 years, with data collection at age 12, 14 and 16. At each wave participants will undergo multiple assessments including a range of selective cognitive processing tasks (e.g. attention bias, interpretation bias, memory bias) and psychological self-report measures (e.g. anxiety, depression, resilience). Saliva samples will also be collected at the baseline assessment for genetic analyses. Multilevel statistical analyses will be performed to investigate the developmental trajectory of cognitive biases on psychological functioning, as well as the influence of genetic moderation on these relationships. Discussion: {CogBIAS}-L-S represents the first longitudinal study to assess multiple cognitive biases across adolescent development and the largest study of its kind to collect genetic data. It therefore provides a unique opportunity to understand how genes and the environment influence the development and maintenance of cognitive biases and provide insight into risk and protective factors that may be key targets for intervention.},

Experiments 1 and 2 confirmed our prediction that {WMC} would be reduced in the context of emotional compared with neutral distractors in student and community samples. Experiment 3 extended these findings to a clinical sample. {WMC} in motor vehicle accident survivors with a history of posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) was selectively reduced in the presence of trauma-related emotional distraction compared with survivors without a history of {PTSD}.

However, there are few guides for psychological researchers that explain how they can quantify which effect sizes are practically meaningful, and which are not. Being able to specify the smallest effect size that is considered practically meaningful facilitates the design of well-powered experiments and enables researchers to falsify predictions by rejecting effects larger than this effect size. We illustrate two methods used in clinical research to determine the minimally detectable difference: the smallest effect size that is associated with a subjectively noticeable change at the individual level. These anchor-based methods provide one possible approach for researchers to determine their smallest effect size of interest, and to interpret the effect size estimates observed in research lines. We discuss the limitations of applying anchor-based methods in psychology, and point out there is ample room for statistical and methodological improvement, but also highlight the potential for anchor-based methods to provide one approach to establish a smallest effect of interest in lines of research.},

Although it is known that emotion regulation strategies, such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, may have divergent consequences for emotional responses, the cognitive processes underlying these differences remain unclear. Here we used eye-tracking to investigate the role of attentional deployment in emotion regulation success. We hypothesized that differences in the deployment of attention to emotional areas of complex visual scenes may be a contributing factor to the differential effects of these two strategies on emotional experience. Eye-movements, pupil size, and self-reported negative emotional experience were measured while healthy young adult participants viewed negative {IAPS} images and regulated their emotional responses using either cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression. Consistent with prior work, reappraisers reported feeling significantly less negative than suppressers when regulating emotion as compared to a baseline condition. Across both groups, participants looked away from emotional areas during emotion regulation, an effect that was more pronounced for suppressers. Critically, irrespective of emotion regulation strategy, participants who looked toward emotional areas of a complex visual scene were more likely to experience emotion regulation success. Taken together, these results demonstrate that attentional deployment varies across emotion regulation strategies and that successful emotion regulation depends on the extent to which people look toward emotional content in complex visual scenes.},

Estimating statistical models where a subset of the data is selected based on a function of the analyzed variables introduces Berkson’s bias, which presents a potential threat to the validity of findings in the clinical literature. The aim of the present paper is to investigate the effect of Berkson’s bias on the performance of the two most commonly used psychological network models, the Gaussian Graphical Model ({GGM}) for continuous and ordinal data, and the Ising Model for binary data. In two simulation studies, we test how well the models perform in recovering the true network when estimation is based on a subset of the data typically seen in clinical studies. The selection of data varies with respect to sample size and the cut-off sum-score of the analyzed variables. Recovery performance is established via three metrics: correlation, sensitivity, and specificity. In addition, the density and the amount of spurious negative edges are measured. Simulation parameters are based on a large clinical dataset of depressed patients. Results of both studies indicate that higher cut-off sum-score values are associated with lower performance on all metrics and more spurious negative edges. Our findings provide evidence that Berkson’s bias is a considerable and underappreciated problem in the clinical network literature.},

Coping and emotion regulation theorists have proposed dynamic models in which these two factors, the person and the situation, interact over time to inform adaptation. In practice, however, researchers have tended to assume that particular regulatory strategies are consistently beneficial or maladaptive. We label this assumption the fallacy of uniform efficacy and contrast it with findings from a number of related literatures that have suggested the emergence of a broader but as yet poorly defined construct that we refer to as regulatory flexibility. In this review, we articulate this broader construct and define both its features and limitations. Specifically, we propose a heuristic individual differences framework and review research on three sequential components of flexibility for which propensities and abilities vary: sensitivity to context, availability of a diverse repertoire of regulatory strategies, and responsiveness to feedback. We consider the methodological limitations of research on each component, review questions that future research on flexibility might address, and consider how the components might relate to each other and to broader conceptualizations about stability and change across persons and situations.},

However, empirical evidence also suggests that it may be salubrious to distract oneself, remain optimistic, and focus on moving past the event. These seemingly contradictory perspectives are integrated in the concept of coping flexibility. This investigation reports the development and validation of a brief questionnaire, the Perceived Ability to Cope With Trauma ({PACT}) scale, with 2 scales that measure the perceived ability to focus on processing the trauma (trauma focus) and to focus on moving beyond the trauma (forward focus). In addition, we created a single flexibility score that represented the ability to use both types of coping. Participants included an Israeli sample with potential high trauma exposure and a sample of American college students. The factor structure of the {PACT} was confirmed in both samples. Preliminary evidence was obtained for the {PACT}’s convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity. Both the Forward Focus and Trauma Focus scales were independently associated with better adjustment, and each scale independently moderated the impact of heightened trauma exposure. Similarly, the combination of these scales into a single parsimonious flexibility score also moderated trauma exposure. Limitations of and future research with the measure are considered.},

	abstract = {The ability to accurately perceive cues to contextual demands across different situations has been identified as a crucial component of successful self-regulation. However, previous attempts to measure context sensitivity have suffered from serious methodological limitations, most notably the possibility that respondents may not possess sufficient knowledge of their own abilities, the confounding of perception of context with response to context, the use of only one or two contextual variations, and the failure to consider the abilities to both accurately detect contextual cues and accurately determine cue absence. This article reports a new, easy-to-administer scenario-based questionnaire measure, the Context Sensitivity Index ({CSI}), that addressed each of these limitations. The 20-item {CSI} was iteratively developed and normed using data from five studies to create separate indices to capture sensitivity to the presence of contextual cues (Cue Presence index) and to the relative absence of cues (Cue Absence index). We validated these indices against measures of flexibility, psychopathology, and other scales. Results are discussed in terms of the {CSI}’s implications, limitations, and future applications.},

In this network approach, psychological constructs are represented as complex systems of interacting components. In addition to insightful visualization of dynamics, a network perspective leads to a new way of thinking about the nature of psychological phenomena by offering new tools for studying dynamical processes in psychology. In this article, we explain the rationale of the network approach, the associated methods and visualization, and illustrate it using an empirical example focusing on the relation between the daily fluctuations of emotions and neuroticism. The results suggest that individuals with high levels of neuroticism had a denser emotion network compared with their less neurotic peers. This effect is especially pronounced for the negative emotion network, which is in line with previous studies that found a denser network in depressed subjects than in healthy subjects. In sum, we show how the network approach may offer new tools for studying dynamical processes in psychology.},

We distinguish between the potential inconsistency of anxiety-linked attentional bias and inconsistency potentially reflecting the psychometric properties of the assessment approaches used to measure it. Though groups with heightened anxiety vulnerability often exhibit, on average, elevated attention to threat, the evidence suggests that individuals are unlikely to each display a stable, invariant attentional bias to threat. Moreover, although existing assessment approaches can differentiate between groups, they do not exhibit the internal consistency or test-retest reliability necessary to classify individuals in terms of their characteristic pattern of attentional responding to threat. We discuss the appropriate uses of existing attentional bias assessment tasks and propose strategies for enhancing classification of individuals in terms of their tendency to display an attentional bias to threat.},

	doi = {10.31219/osf.io/8xgkb},
	abstract = {Background: Childhood adversity ({CA}), such as trauma or long-lasting stress, is strongly associated with mental health problems. Resilience factors ({RFs}) reduce the liability for mental health problems subsequent to {CA}. As mental health levels change over time, {RFs} may also change. Yet, knowledge on the latter is scarce. Therefore, we examined whether {RF} mean levels, {RF} interrelations, and {RF} pathways to distress change between early (age 14) and later adolescence (age 17).
Methods: We studied 10 empirically-supported {RFs} in adolescents with ({CA}+; n=638) and without {CA} ({CA}-; n=501). {RF} interrelations and {RF}-distress pathways were modelled using regularized partial correlation networks.
Results: The {CA}+ group had lower {RFs} and higher distress at both ages. All inter-personal {RFs} (e.g. friendships) showed stable mean levels between age 14 and 17, whereas five of seven intra-personal {RFs} (e.g. distress-tolerance) changed. All {RF} level changes were similar for adolescents with and without {CA}. Regarding {RF} interrelations we found that at age 14, but not at age 17, the {RF} network of the {CA}+ group was less positively connected, suggesting that the {RFs} are less likely to enhance each other than in the {CA}- group. Many negative direct pathways emerged between {RFs} and distress. Over time, the number of these pathways decreased from seven to five in the {CA}+, but increased from three to five in the {CA}- network. In the {CA}+ group these pathways may be less advantageous, as lower {RFs} are less likely to decrease higher distress.
Conclusion: Persistent lower {RFs}, higher distress, and potentially disadvantaged {RF}-distress pathways suggest that {RFs} in the {CA}+ group offer less protection against mental health problems. These findings may explain why exposure to {CA} has strong proximal effects, and is often found to have a lasting impact on mental health.},

A key assumption of the {GGM} is that each pairwise interaction is independent of the values of all other variables. However, in psychological research this is often implausible. In this paper, we extend the {GGM} by allowing each pairwise interaction between two variables to be moderated by (a subset of) all other variables in the model, and thereby introduce a Moderated Network Model ({MNM}). We show how to construct the {MNW} and propose an 1-regularized nodewise regression approach to estimate it. We provide performance results in a simulation study and show that {MNMs} outperform the split-sample based methods Network Comparison Test ({NCT}) and Fused Graphical Lasso ({FGL}) in detecting moderation eﬀects. Finally, we provide a fully reproducible tutorial on how to estimate {MNMs} with the R-package mgm and discuss possible issues with model misspeciﬁcation.},

We close this methodological gap by introducing nodewise predictability, which quantifies how well a given node can be predicted by all other nodes it is connected to in the network. In addition, we provide fully reproducible code examples of how to compute and visualize nodewise predictability both for cross-sectional and time series data.},

Little research has examined the psychometric properties of the {VPT}, despite concerns it demonstrates poor test–retest reliability and internal consistency. These issues can reduce confidence in inferences based on {VPT} performance. As such, we attempted to identify parameters under which the reliability of the alcohol {VPT} might be improved by applying recent empirical recommendations for outlier handling, bias calculation, and task design from the anxiety literature. We reanalyzed data from 3 previously published studies in our laboratory and 2 newly collected data sets. We compared tasks which presented images on the left/right of the screen to above/below, whether participants responded to the location or content of the probe, and whether general alcohol-related images or images personalized to the individual were used. In each {VPT} we also applied a priori outlier removal (2 and 3 standard deviations and median absolute difference) and data-driven outlier removal (winsorizing), in addition to calculating trial-level bias scores. Across all studies and tasks internal consistency and test–retest reliability of attentional bias measures were inadequate. There was no consistent improvement in internal consistency or test–retest reliability as a function of outlier removal methods. We were unable to demonstrate adequate reliability of the alcohol {VPT}, which further supports observations that these tasks may not yield reliable measures. Future research should focus on improving the reliability of these tasks or abandoning them in favor of more reliable alternatives.},

	abstract = {We conducted preregistered replications of 28 classic and contemporary published findings, with protocols that were peer reviewed in advance, to examine variation in effect magnitudes across samples and settings. Each protocol was administered to approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305 participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the conventional criterion of statistical significance (p {\textless} .05), we found that 15 (54\%) of the replications provided evidence of a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original finding. With a strict significance criterion (p {\textless} .0001), 14 (50\%) of the replications still provided such evidence, a reflection of the extremely highpowered design. Seven (25\%) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger than the original ones, and 21 (75\%) yielded effect sizes smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen’s ds were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the replications. The effect sizes were small ({\textless} 0.20) in 16 of the replications (57\%), and 9 effects (32\%) were in the direction opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings, the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39\%) of the replication effects, and most of those were among the findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity. Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic ({WEIRD}) cultures and less {WEIRD} cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low {WEIRDness} scores, respectively). Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied.},

	abstract = {Objective: Frequent co-occurrence and bidirectional longitudinal associations have led some researchers to question the boundaries between depression and anxiety. A longitudinal investigation of the interconnected symptom structure of these constructs may help determine the extent to which they are distinct, and whether this changes over development. Therefore, the present study used network analysis to examine these {symptomÀsymptom} associations developmentally from early childhood to mid-adolescence.
Method: We analyzed data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N ¼ 1,147). Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed on 7 occasions between ages 5 and 14 years using maternal reports. Regularized partial correlation networks were constructed at each time point, and diagnostic boundaries were explored using empirical tests of network modularity (ie, clustering of symptom nodes). Nonparametric permutation tests were used to determine whether symptoms became more associated over development, and network centrality was examined to identify developmental changes in the overall importance of speciﬁc symptoms.
Results: Symptoms formed highly interconnected networks, as evidenced by strong associations between depression and anxiety symptoms and a lack of distinct clustering. There was some evidence of an increase in overall connectivity as children aged. Feeling “anxious/fearful” and “unhappy/sad” were consistently the most central symptoms over development.
Conclusion: Minimal clustering of nodes indicated no separation of depression and anxiety symptoms from early childhood through mid-adolescence. An increase in connectivity over development suggests that symptoms may reinforce each other, potentially contributing to the high levels of lifetime continuity of these disorders.},

	title = {Reaction times and other skewed distributions: problems with the mean and the median},
	abstract = {To summarise skewed (asymmetric) distributions, such as reaction times, typically the mean or the median are used as measures of central tendency. Using the mean might seem surprising, given that it provides a poor measure of central tendency for skewed distributions, whereas the median provides a better indication of the location of the bulk of the observations. However, the sample median is biased: with small sample sizes, it tends to overestimate the population median. This is not the case for the mean. Based on this observation, Miller (1988) concluded that ”sample medians must not be used to compare reaction times across experimental conditions when there are unequal numbers of trials in the conditions.” Here we replicate and extend Miller (1988), and demonstrate that his conclusion was ill-advised for several reasons. First, the median’s bias can be corrected using a percentile bootstrap bias correction. Second, a careful examination of the sampling distributions reveals that the sample median is median unbiased, whereas the mean is median biased when dealing with skewed distributions. That is, on average the sample mean estimates the population mean, but typically this is not the case. In addition, simulations of false and true positives in various situations show that no method dominates. Crucially, neither the mean nor the median are sufﬁcient or even necessary to compare skewed distributions. Different questions require different methods and it would be unwise to use the mean or the median in all situations. Better tools are available to get a deeper understanding of how distributions differ: we illustrate a powerful alternative that relies on quantile estimation. All the code and data to reproduce the ﬁgures and analyses in the article are available online.},

That perspective assumes that psychological variables conform to a common factor model, such that they consist of construct variance plus error. In this paper, we explore what happens when a set of items that are not generated from a common factor construct model are nonetheless modeled as reflecting a common factor. Through a series of hypothetical examples and an empirical re-analysis, we show that (1) common factor models tend to produce extremely biased and highly variable structural parameter estimates when the population model is not a common factor model; (2) model fit is a poor indicator of the degree of bias; and (3) composite models are sometimes more reliable than common factor models under alternative measurement structures, though they also lead to unacceptably bad solutions in some cases.},

	abstract = {An ever-growing number of transdiagnostic processes that maintain psychopathology across disorders have been identified. However, such processes are not consistently associated with psychological distress and symptoms. An understanding of what makes such processes pathological is required. One possibility is that individual differences in rigidity in the implementation of these processes determine the degree of psychopathology. The aim of this article is to examine the relationship between rigidity/flexibility and transdiagnostic maintenance processes. Initial searches were made for research examining relationships between 18 transdiagnostic processes and rigidity/flexibility. Relationships between rumination, perfectionism, impulsivity and compulsivity, and rigidity/flexibility were systemically reviewed; 50 studies met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies indicated that transdiagnostic cognitive and behavioral maintenance processes and rigidity were correlated, co-occurring, or predictive of each other. Findings are consistent with the hypothesis that it is inflexibility in the manner in which processes are employed that makes them pathologically problematic. However, further research is required to test and establish this.},

We explored within-person associations between spoken words and selfreported state emotion among 185 participants who wore the Electronically Activated Recorder ({EAR}; an unobtrusive audio recording device) and completed experience sampling reports of their positive and negative emotions four times per day for seven days (1,579 observations). We examined language using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program ({LIWC}; theoretically created dictionaries) and open-vocabulary themes (clusters of data-driven semantically-related words). Although some studies give the impression that {LIWC}’s positive and negative emotion dictionaries can be used as indicators of emotion experience, we found that when computed on spoken language, {LIWC} emotion scores were not significantly associated with self-reports of state emotion experience. Exploration of other categories of language variables suggests a number of hypotheses about substantive everyday correlates of momentary positive and negative emotion that can be tested in future studies. These findings (1) suggest that {LIWC} positive and negative emotion dictionaries may not capture self-reported subjective emotion experience when applied to everyday speech, (2) emphasize the importance of establishing the validity of language-based measures within one’s target domain, (3) demonstrate the potential for developing new hypotheses about personality processes from the open-ended words that occur in everyday speech, and (4) extend perspectives on intra-individual variability to the domain of spoken language.},

We argue that psychology’s near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led much of the field to be populated by research programs that provide intricate theories of psychological mechanism but that have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with any appreciable accuracy. We propose that principles and techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology become a more predictive science. We review some of the fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out examples where these concepts have been used to conduct interesting and important psychological research that focuses on predictive research questions. We suggest that an increased focus on prediction, rather than explanation, can ultimately lead us to greater understanding of behavior.},

	abstract = {Establishing correlations among common inhibition tasks such as Stroop or ﬂanker tasks has been proven quite diﬃcult despite many attempts. It remains unknown whether this diﬃculty occurs because inhibition is a disparate set of phenomena or whether the analytical techiques to uncover a uniﬁed inhibition phenomenon fail in real-world contexts. In this paper, we explore the ﬁeld-wide inability to assess whether inhibition is uniﬁed or disparate. We do so by showing that ordinary methods of correlating performance including those with latent variable models are doomed to fail because of trial noise (or, as it is sometimes called, measurement error). We then develop hierarchical models that account for variation across trials, variation across individuals, and covariation across individuals and tasks. These hierarchical models also fail to uncover correlations in typical designs for the same reasons. While we can charaterize the degree of trial noise, we cannot recover correlations in typical designs that enroll hundreds of people. We discuss possible improvements to study designs to help uncovering correlations, though we are not sure how feasible they are.},

	abstract = {In modern individual-diﬀerence studies, researchers often correlate performance on various tasks to uncover common latent processes. Yet, in some sense, the results have been disappointing as correlations among tasks that seemingly have processes in common are often low. A pressing question then is whether these attenuated correlations reﬂect statistical considerations, such as a lack of individual variability on tasks, or substantive considerations, such as that inhibition in diﬀerent tasks is not a uniﬁed concept. One problem in addressing this question is that researchers aggregate performance across trials to tally individual-by-task scores, and the covariation of these scores is subsequently studied much as it would be with classical test theory. It is tempting to think that aggregation here is ﬁne and everything comes out in the wash, but as shown here, it greately attenuates measures of eﬀect size and correlation. We propose an alternative psychometrics of task performance that is based on accounting for trial-by-trial variability along with the covariation of individuals’ performance across tasks. The implementation is through common hierarchical models, and this treatment rescues classical concepts of eﬀect size, reliability, and correlation for studying individual diﬀerences with experimental tasks. Using recent data from Hedge et al. (2018) we show that there is Bayes-factor support for a lack of correlation between the Stroop and ﬂanker task. This support for a lack of correlation indicates a psychologically relevant result—Stroop and ﬂanker inhibition are seemingly unrelated, contradicting uniﬁed concepts of inhibition.},

	title = {Power, Dominance, and Constraint: A Note on the Appeal of Different Design Traditions},
	volume = {1},
	abstract = {The recent field-wide emphasis on power has brought the number of participants used in psychological experiments into focus. Social psychology typically follows a tradition in which many participants perform a small number of trials each; in psychophysics, the tradition is to include only a few participants, who perform many trials each; and the tradition in cognitive psychology falls in between, balancing the number of participants and trials. We ask whether it is better to add trials or to add participants if one wishes to increase power. The answer is straightforward—greatest power is achieved by using more people, and the gain from adding people is greater than the gain from adding trials. In light of these results, the design parameters in the social psychology tradition seem ideal. Yet there are conditions in which one may trade people for trials with only a minor decrement in power. Under these conditions, the limiting factor is the trial-to-trial variability rather than the variability across people in the population. These conditions are highly plausible, and we present a theoretical argument as to why. We think that most cognitive effects are characterized by stochastic dominance; that is, everyone’s true effect is in the same direction. For example, it is plausible that when performing the Stroop task, all people truly identify congruent colors faster than incongruent ones. When dominance holds, small mean effects imply a small degree of variability across the population. It is this degree of homogeneity, the consequence of dominance, that licenses the design parameters of the cognitive psychology and psychophysics traditions.},

In genetic epidemiology, it has varied from very high values (possibly even Ͼ100:1) for associations reported in candidate-gene studies to very low values (1:100 or lower) for associations with genome-wide signiﬁcance. The substantial reduction over time in the {FP}:{FN} ratio in human genome epidemiology has corresponded to the routine adoption of stringent inferential criteria and comprehensive, agnostic reporting of all analyses. Most traditional ﬁelds of epidemiologic research more closely follow the practices of past candidate gene epidemiology, and thus have high {FP}:{FN} ratios. Further, {FP} and {FN} results do not necessarily entail the same consequences, and their relative importance may vary in different settings. This ultimately has implications for what is the acceptable {FP}:{FN} ratio and for how the results of published epidemiologic studies should be presented and interpreted.},

	abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research ﬁndings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientiﬁc ﬁeld. In this framework, a research ﬁnding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a ﬁeld are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater ﬂexibility in designs, deﬁnitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater ﬁnancial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientiﬁc ﬁeld in chase of statistical signiﬁcance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientiﬁc ﬁelds, claimed research ﬁndings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

We focus on the historical lack of reliability of attentional bias measures as an illustration of how reliability can pose a threat to our understanding. Our own data replicate previous findings of poor reliability for traditionallyused scores, which suggests a serious problem with the ability to test theories regarding attentional bias. This lack of reliability may also suggest problems with the assumption (in both theory and the formula for the scores) that attentional bias is consistent and stable across time.

Second, {JASP} provides some of the recent developments in Bayesian hypothesis testing and Bayesian parameter estimation. The ease with which these relatively complex Bayesian techniques are available in {JASP} encourages their broader adoption and furthers a more inclusive statistical reporting practice.

	title = {Response interference tasks as indirect measures of automatic associations.},
	isbn = {978-1-60623-015-2 (Hardcover)},
	abstract = {A large proportion of research in social psychology uses self-report measures to assess socially relevant constructs, such as attitudes, stereotypes, self-concepts, and self-esteem. Over the past century, self-report measures have provided important insights that built the foundation for many prominent theories in the field. At the same time, there have been persistent concerns that self-report measures are suboptimal research tools for at least two reasons. First, responses on self-report measures are susceptible to self-presentation, which may distort measurement outcomes in socially sensitive domains. Second, there is consensus that many psychological processes operate outside of conscious awareness, which undermines the suitability of self-report measures to assess mental contents that are introspectively inaccessible. To overcome these problems, psychologists have developed various indirect measurement procedures that (1) reduce participants' ability to control their responses, and (2) do not require introspection for the assessment of mental contents. This chapter reviews a particularly influential class of indirect measurement procedures, namely, experimental paradigms based on response interference ({RI}). For this purpose, we first provide a general context for our review of {RI} tasks by defining a number of relevant concepts and briefly describing the history of {RI} tasks in social psychology. After explaining the basic logic of {RI}, we then review different kinds of measures based on {RI}, including general information about their procedures, implementation, and scoring. We conclude our chapter with a discussion of general issues regarding the interpretation of {RI} effects and a pragmatically oriented comparison of the reviewed tasks. The tasks reviewed in this chapter—including the sequential priming tasks reviewed by Spruyt et al.—are often referred to as implicit measures. A common source of confusion with regard to this label is the meaning of the term implicit, which is further discussed in this chapter. In this chapter, we follow suggestions by De Houwer to use the terms direct and indirect to describe features of measurement procedures, and the terms implicit and explicit to describe features of the psychological attributes assessed by different measurement procedures. In terms of De Houwer's distinction, {RI} tasks fall under the category of indirect measurement procedures, in that participants are not asked directly to provide a self-assessment of the relevant psychological attribute. Another important issue concerns terminology for the particular constructs assessed by {RI} tasks. We describe the constructs assessed by {RI} tasks as automatic associations. Note, however, that the presumed automatic nature of these associations is not guaranteed by the indirect nature of the measurement procedures. Whether the associations assessed by {RI} tasks are indeed unconscious, efficient, unintentional, and/or uncontrollable is an empirical question that has to be tested by means of carefully designed studies. Thus, our use of the term automatic association simply reflects the general purpose of {RI} tasks to assess associations that are in fact automatic rather than a methodological necessity that is logically implied by the indirect nature of {RI} tasks. We return to this issue in the concluding sections of this chapter when we discuss general issues regarding the interpretation of measurement scores.
